[This is the first of a series of occasional journalistic entries concerning the recent fortuitous discovery of cancer cells in my abdomen, and my struggle to put this shocking, new condition into perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp; The presentation will be honest and in my own particular style.&nbsp; Phillip Danzig]<BR>

Howard Stern went 'off the air' recently for using obscenity, scatology, 'pushing the envelop too far' and other excess which have characterized and obsessed the psycho-sexual landscape of the entire 20th Century.&nbsp; He was brought down by a combination of Orthodox, Fundamentalist Christian and outraged secular citizens and the FTC, cheered on, no doubt, by the growing group of Fundamentalist Muslims here in the USA.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
But there are several other sets of words which remain largely 'in the closet,' beyond the pale and spoken of mainly in hushed terms.&nbsp; Among these, I have recently become personally familiar with 'Chemotherapy,' 'Metastasis,' and 'Cancer.'<BR>
<BR>
Following a routine CAT Scan this past January, to probe my long standing Crohn's Disease,&nbsp; my Doctor informed me that "evidence of&nbsp; masses were found in my liver."&nbsp;&nbsp; My previous scan, the previous February, had shown nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Profoundly shocked,&nbsp; I asked, "Is this a tumor?"&nbsp;&nbsp; 'No,'&nbsp; he said.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Feeling my head entering hyperspace, I quietly asked,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we talking ... Cancer ?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Yes,' came the clinical reply.<BR>
<BR>
"Liver Cancer ?"&nbsp; 'No, these cells have originated elsewhere.'<BR>
<BR>
Then it's spreading, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With my voice echoing from somewhere between Jupiter and Neptune,&nbsp; I forced myself to ask,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, where are they coming from ?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We don't know that, yet,' the Doctor said, "but the good news is, we found it early."&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Unable to distract my head with further questions, tears welled into my eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Janet, the nurse, gave me a needed hug and said, "Don't worry, we'll stay with you through this.. ..'<BR>
<BR>
"Okay," I thought:&nbsp;&nbsp; "I might live three months, 13 months, or 30 years.&nbsp; Or, the proverbial elevator cable could snap when I return home, today."<BR>
<BR>
I confided in only a few close friends, waiting to get more factual information.&nbsp; My alementary canal wa probed from top and bottom:&nbsp; An Endoscopy proved Negative [in medical parliance, 'Negative,'&nbsp; is often actually 'positive" - "Nothing Found']&nbsp; as did a Colonoscopy.&nbsp; A liver biopsy<BR>
suggested the small bowel or the pancreas as the organ of origin.&nbsp; My Gastroenterologist suggested I select an Oncologist.<BR>
<BR>
Several days had passed.&nbsp; It was time to inform my three sons.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; pointed out the absence of a<BR>
firm diagnosis, but emphasized the presence of several hopeful avenues I was already pursuing.&nbsp; <BR>
I spoke with&nbsp; some knowledgeable members of my congregation, the Town and Village Synagogue.&nbsp;&nbsp; One mystical tradition holds that every congregation contains a Tsadik [Righteous<BR>
One] and a Roshe [Wicked One]:&nbsp; What I soon learned, however,&nbsp; was that Town and Village also held a Professor of Cell Biology at the New York University Medical Center, and the<BR>
Director of Research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering.&nbsp;&nbsp; They helped me to set up a consultation at Memorial S-K a week later.<BR>
<BR>
But I also mentioned my predicament to Rabbi Meir Fund, whose Kaballah classes I have attended for over three years.&nbsp; I have provided some minor architectural assistance for his<BR>
newly-located, "Flatbush Minyan," and I am one of the few in the class who had attended services and concerts of his great friend, Rabbi Schlomo Carlebach.<BR>
<BR>
"Unbelievable !" Rabbi Fund told me.&nbsp; "I know an Oncologist who has achieved amazing successes.&nbsp; You must see him."&nbsp; Next day, I phoned the office of Dr. Howard Bruckner to make<BR>
an appointment.&nbsp; 'And who is the Recommending Physician ?' I was asked.&nbsp; "Rabbi Meir Fund,"&nbsp; I replied.&nbsp; I had an appointment in three days. <BR>
<BR>
Checking around I found that Dr. Bruckner had, indeed, a major reputation.&nbsp; Trained at Yale, formerly on the staff at Mt. Sinai, he was now Director of Medical Oncology at the Lutheran Medical Center, in Brooklyn.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brooklyn?"&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought, "that's where I was born.&nbsp; I"m going home."&nbsp; And half-a-dozen people I talked to spoke highly of Doctor Bruckner, including my medical contacts at T&amp;V.&nbsp; All mentioned his "unorthodox treatments" and unusual successes.<BR>
<BR>
I prepared for the consultation.<BR>
