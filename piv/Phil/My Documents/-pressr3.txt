FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

GARDENERS DRESSED AS WILDFLOWERS, PEA PODS, AND PLANTS PARADE TO OVER 35 LOWER EAST SIDE GARDENS CELEBRATING THE VICTORIOUS SAVING OF 112 NEW YORK CITY COMMUNITY GARDENS THAT WERE SLATED FOR DESTRUCTION BY UPCOMING CITY AUCTIONS.

On Saturday, May 22, 1999 (raindate: Sunday, May 23),  EARTH CELEBRATIONS NINTH ANNUAL RITES OF SPRING:  PROCESSION TO SAVE OUR GARDENS directed by Felicia Young, enacts a victorious day-long parade and mythic pageant that celebrates the unprecedented saving of 112 gardens from auction this past week. The 12-hour pageant, from 10am-10pm, visits over 35 magnificent gardens on the Lower East Side with giants puppets, spectacular costumes,
performance, dance, music, and poetry, celebrating the gardens and the decade-long struggle to preserve them.

An annual mythic play is performed throughout the day, enacting the story of Gaia (representing the gardens), and her birth, marriage, kidnapping  by truckload of masked developers in business suits, and her eventual saving by the butterfly children and community. In a momentous battle scene with spectacular smoke clouds of flour, masked developers, giant bulldozers, auction gavels, and development monsters, surrender to the butterflychildren and costumed garden spirits. The saving of Gaia this year, is not just a theatrical ideal, but a finally a reality! Last week's saving of the gardens from auction, with the hope to save more, is celebrated with the
release of 50 live butterflies at the end of the day.

This year's pageant comes one week after the victorious announcement that the Trust For Public Land with 3.2 million dollars and an additional 1.2 million dollars from Bette Midler, made a deal with the city, purchasing and preserving  the 112 gardens that were to be sold auction on May 14th.  However, in addition to the gardens saved from this auction, most of the 776 community gardens citywide are still threatened with destruction by proposed development plans. We hope the victory over this auction signals a new city policy towards the preservation of New York City's community
gardens.

Earth Celebrations is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing environmental issues through the arts. Since, 1991, Earth Celebrations has been working to preserve the community gardens through innovative and creative programs, theatrical pageants, and a Lower East Side and city-wide garden preservation initiative.


GARDEN PRESERVATION ISSUE:

The network of over 50 community gardens were created out of rubble-strewn vacant lots into magnificent oases of trees, flowers, ponds, and vegetable gardens in the city. These gardens provide millions of dollars worth of social, ecological, educational, health, and cultural services to the community free of cost to the city. This is not an issue of housing VS. Gardens. The city has 11,000-14,000 vacant lots which can be developed before the 776 gardens city-wide are destroyed. In addition, the city auctions that were intended for last week, targeted to sell gardens that were too small and not viable for housing. If sold, many of these gardens after years of hard work and positive community effort, would have become garbage dumping grounds.

When the city targeted these sites for development 20 years ago, there was no precedent for how these gardens would transform these neighborhoods throughout the city. The gardens provide not only needed open space, but also provide a vital function as outdoor community, environmental and cultural centers. The gardens are at the heart of the positive and creative efforts of local residents working together to counteract the negative influences of drugs, crime, and pollution. Now that 20-25 years has passed, the City needs to re-examine the current needs of these neighborhoods, and evaluate the loss of one of these city's greatest ecological treasures.  With the victory of saving 112 gardens into a land trust in perpetuity, we hope that this is the beginning of a new city policy toward the preservation of the nearly 700 gardens that still remian under threat. The community gardens of New York City are an exemplary model of urban improvisation that provides a model of ecological balance in the city that should be preserved for future generations.
