Do you know anything more since yesterday?&nbsp; I am concerned and have been <BR>
thinking about it.&nbsp; Let me know.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FACE="RomanFixedWidth" LANG="0">WELL, NACHUM, THE BEST NEWS WHICH WILL COME NEXT is that they have found specifically the causative organ, and R. Groisser is still working on that.&nbsp; Today I went to Montclair and he performed an endoscopy,&nbsp; poking a lighted TV camera down my throat, into the belly and out the Pylorus valve.&nbsp; [I love writing Pylorus Valve !&nbsp; Sounds so Greek !<BR>
<BR>
The good news is the bad news:&nbsp; Groisser found small 'grains' on the lining of the stomach, which do not belong there.&nbsp; Bad that they are there, good that he found them.&nbsp; He snatched a few and these are out for biopsy.&nbsp; I told Groisser that I intend to be treated in NYC and he agree.. ..<BR>
<BR>
Thursday I will return to Mountainside and he will do another colonoscopy:&nbsp; he does one almost every year on me&nbsp; [in me].&nbsp; In June he found some polyps there, but they tested benign, fortunately.<BR>
<BR>
I also spoke with Lew Freedman, the alternate Gabbi in my synagogue, who is the Chief Administrator at Memorial Sloan-Kettering.&nbsp; [They are one of the best in NYC, the country and the world in this area.]<BR>
<BR>
After Groisser has worked up a complete brief [one even Colon Powell would find suitable to present to the United Nations !] with documentation [after Thursday] it will be looked at by him, also by Dr. Michael Freedman [my Geriatric Doctor at NYU] and Lew Freedman, and a decision will be made as to where this matter will be treated.&nbsp; NYU is acceptable to me, and so Is Memorial SK.&nbsp; Lew [thank G-d] told me that one of his friends is a liver specialist at Memorial, and that his word [Lew's] means a lot.<BR>
<BR>
I consider myself a very lucky man.&nbsp; And prudent too, since I hooked up with DR. Freedman 3 - 4 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
I will send this E-mail to your brothers, to spare me having to duplicate it&nbsp; --&nbsp; the support of each of you is very evident, very precious and comforting to me. <BR>
<BR>
I love each of you guys.. .. ..&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad<BR>
