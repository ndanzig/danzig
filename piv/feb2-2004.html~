<BR>
Just to keep you posted, but the truth is, that these things move very slowly.<BR>
<BR>
I do not know the results of the three tests taken on Thursday but I have requested from Mountainside that ALL relevant information ++ scans, reports, the MRI, biopsy, etc., be sent overnight [tonight] to me here in NYC.&nbsp; These are more valuable now to me than 'passports' and I will deliver them in person to Sloan Kettering, which is the best diagnostic facility in the world.&nbsp; The stuff will be seen by one or two Drs. @ Sloan and a diagnosis made.&nbsp; They will suggest a course of treatment.&nbsp; That day ?&nbsp; or the next I do not know.<BR>
<BR>
[It's like Kindergarten:&nbsp;&nbsp; after I will have gone through it, I will then know what it's all about.. ..]&nbsp; If you have any questions or suggestions whatsoever, please let me know.<BR>
<BR>
I will consult with Dr. Freedman at NY University Hospital, and maybe Dr. Groisser, as a curtesy.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the operative word is 'Patience.'&nbsp; They say that patience is the one virtue you cannot practice up for.<BR>
<BR>
Do you know [amazingly] that I have given two mosaic workshops at the Creative Center for Women Surviving Cancer ?&nbsp;&nbsp; [They recently dropped the word 'Women' from their title.]&nbsp; So I spoke with Jerry, the Director, who knows a lot about these things.&nbsp; [She agreed with Gavriel that I seem to have a good, clear 'handle' on what's going on, so far as it is knowable so far.]&nbsp; She said that the timing of what is being done is reasonable and normal, given that this is not a primary liver cancer, and that I shouldn't rush into anything.&nbsp; She also said that most Doctors today understand the need patients have to work with alternate practitioners at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
Sunday, I went to a small art viewing given by Rabbi Rottenstreich [the Lubavicher] and I told him about my situation.&nbsp; He said the important thing is to remain optimistic, and to dress well !&nbsp; That a positive attitude will show the Doctors that I am serious about being cured, and that that will affect their attitude and performance as well.&nbsp; [Amazing ! ]&nbsp; He said that his brother went through this last year, and that his mother is a 'survivor' going on eight years.<BR>
<BR>
So, I am investigating, and collecting stories and gaining information and developing an approach.&nbsp; I will speak with cousin Mark tonight and check out alternate therapies at the right time.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Funnily enough, this week I hired a painter to remove Hilda's flowered wall paper and he will paint the bedroom a nice yellow.&nbsp; Should look bright !&nbsp; He is here with me in the apartment, moving boxes and books.&nbsp; And I am actually throwing things out !&nbsp; Will wonders never cease ?<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you each health, safety, prosperity, long life and prosperity, personally and for all of the family.<BR>
<BR>
Love,&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad<BR>
