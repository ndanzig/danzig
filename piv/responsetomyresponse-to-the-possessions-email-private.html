I understand your reluctance regarding the possessions,&nbsp; as I have the same reluctance, but it is my responsibility to deal responsibly.&nbsp; For example, if nobody has room for the oil portrait in blue of me by WAL, I can sell it or offer it to the NY Historical Society.&nbsp; {Not for the subject, but WAL is in their collections.]&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets NOT&nbsp; go further on this.<BR>
<BR>
Regarding Elizabeth, I support whatever is your decision, of course.&nbsp; {Or hers ? ]&nbsp; But I had just been thinking, that after all these months you still have not resolved the initial complaints, her bossiness/opinionism or, your inability to find a way around your perceptions.&nbsp; Since this has/had not happened, I feared for continuing the relationship.<BR>
<BR>
It is NOT my place to say I think, on balance, you made the 'right' move, but I think, in all probability, that you did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about finding a less sophisticated, non-American young woman ?<BR>
<BR>
I will try to phone you right now !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:00&nbsp; PM&nbsp; EST<BR>
<BR>
Much love, in your hour of need,&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad<BR>
