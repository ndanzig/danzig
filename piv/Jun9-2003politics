<BR>
2.&nbsp; It could just mean "get the Jews out."&nbsp; But when Israel left the Sinai, General Sharon removed settlers and destroyed the buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, only a few people [Arabs] want to live in the Sinai, so the situation in Ephriam may be seen differently.<BR>
<BR>
3.&nbsp; If the Israeli government leaves the buildings, they could/would/should require compensation from the PAL.&nbsp;&nbsp; How could the PAL ever pay for this ?&nbsp; Equivalent to what the Isrealis 'owe' in retained taxes, I suppose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the EU and USA help ? Would Arabs want to live in Israeli-style housing ?<BR>
<BR>
The thought emerges that, should the 200,000 Jews actually leave, all or part of Judea, etc., these dwellings could accommodate a portion of the 4,500,000 Refugees !&nbsp;&nbsp; But how would these Arab live ?&nbsp; Most Jews in the Disputed Territory commute to work near Tel Aviv, or Jerusalem, I believe.&nbsp; Few Settlements are 'self-supporting.'&nbsp; They are mostly modern 'bedroom suburbs.'<BR>

4.&nbsp; I have posted&nbsp; the following Question on my ABUZZ site:<BR>
<BR>
&lt;&lt;&lt;</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">Why do certain people get so excited about 200,000 Settlers living in the historic land of Israel, <BR>
<BR>
yet NEVER seem to notice that there are 1,200,000 Arab Palestinian Israelis living in the modern state of Israel, enjoying economic, social, political and religious freedom ?<BR>
<BR>
How come, what's 'good for the goose' is NOT 'good for the gander' ?    &gt;&gt;&gt; <BR>
<BR>
5.&nbsp; Finally, on my last trip to Eli, I saw the construction of a series of huge&nbsp; electrical high-tension towers, maybe 80 - 100 feet in the air, to replace the usual power supply on telegraph poles,&nbsp; It is hard to believe that Israel would be doing this [Past Ariel and towards Tapuah] while they are really considering 'dismantling.. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>

my first reaction to the question is "are you being cynical"<BR>
I.e. do you mean to say that the proof they don't really want the west <BR>
bank back and all they want&nbsp; is to destroy the Jews is that they want <BR>
these useful houses destroyed.<BR>
<BR>
On second thought, the arabs may feel<BR>
if the buildings remain, then the settlers will return to the houses the <BR>
minute the guards leave. (as long as it is still not a Pal. State)<BR>
<BR>
I suppose your question is really,<BR>
why not let the settlers remain and build and build. and then when the <BR>
arabs take the&nbsp; land they will have well built towns to use.<BR>
shouldn't the arabs be in favor of setlements?<BR>
<BR>
the answer to this is that the buildings become bargaining chips <BR>
for the Israelis.&nbsp; the assumption of the arabs is that we really won't <BR>
give them everything back, and the more we have occupied the&nbsp; less they <BR>
will get., even though I beleive they will never accept anything <BR>
short of everything. so why do they care how many chips we have?<BR>
<BR>
i guess there is some contradiction in their thinking.<BR>

&gt; I'm trying to understand something in the politics of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks - what is all this talk about "dismantling" settlements?&nbsp; Why not just require the people in them to leave?&nbsp; If most of the West Bank eventually becomes a Palestinian state, then wouldn't the Palestinians want the buildings or whatever to be there?&nbsp; Why is the destruction necessary or helpful?&nbsp; It costs time and money, and ends up hurting the Palestinians, as far as I can tell.<BR>

&gt; Am I missing something?<BR>
