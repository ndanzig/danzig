Dear Nachum<BR>


<BR>
Well, I had an unbelievable day, today, and I did not feel alone.<BR>
<BR>
I awoke at 9:15 AM after a dream in which I had to drive through a vehicle tunnel on a Police motorcycle, amid much confusion.&nbsp; I saw Leah walking on the side of the road but felt uneasy about offering her a ride.&nbsp; When I got to the other side my finger started bothering me:&nbsp; seems my old 'Planter's Wart' had swollen up, and I know I had to treat it.<BR>
<BR>
[This wart was treated ten years ago and has NOT returned.]<BR>
<BR>
But that's not all:&nbsp; I had to shower, shave, eat and dress quickly, as I had to make the 10:30 AM bus to Montclair, for my fourth Infusion treatment.&nbsp; I left Stewart House at 9:50 and made the bus in good time.&nbsp; The Infusion started at 11:30 AM and it went without incident [the medicine costs Medicare $4,000].&nbsp; I used the time to sort out my five rolls of Israeli photos, and picked out a few for you [but I have yet to go through the 15 rolls from Egypt].<BR>
<BR>
The Infusion was over at 3:00 PM and I wondered, could I make the 3:30 bus back to NYC ?&nbsp; I had had the foresight to take all the things for you with me, so I could go directly out to Brooklyn and give them to Bonnie.&nbsp; [I couldn't see her the day before, but told her I would bring more than she could carry, and she should just say STOP ! whenever she ran out of space.]&nbsp; But could I make her house before 4:30 PM when she would leave for the airport ?<BR>
<BR>
I phoned Bonnie and told her I could NOT possibly get to her house in Park Slope before 4:30, which is the time she gave me.&nbsp; I knew the #66 bus was out of the question, so I walked to Bay and Broad Streets, Broomfield, and guess what ? !&nbsp; Just as I got to the corner, the #88 pulled up, and I got on.&nbsp; This run had no traffic delays, and I was in Port Authority at 4:00 PM<BR>
<BR>
Having taken the subway schedule with me, I figured out that I had to take the 'A' train to Broadway-Nassau and change there for the # 2 or #3.&nbsp; Again, the 'A' train pulled into the station just as I arrived, and I also caught the #3 to Brooklyn in a timely fashion.<BR>
<BR>
I got off one stop too early [I had gotten the proper station for the 'Q' train from Bonnie, but was now on the #3].&nbsp; So I phoned Bonnie who reported that her Dad had just left for the auto !&nbsp; I negotiated the one block over, two down in the cold, 30 degree wind, and&nbsp; Behold ! There was Her mother, on the steps of #190 Lincoln Place.&nbsp; So, I made it!<BR>
<BR>
Bonnie was able to fit in your sweater, the shirt, both vitamin bottles, an envelop of miscellaneous papers and four can openers.&nbsp; These latter are better than the ones available in Israel, and are for You, for Rachele, for Rivkah and for Leah.&nbsp; The contents of the envelop should be obvious:&nbsp; photos for you, a booklet on Israel for you [with my entry on page 56], the calendar which I neglected to give you on my previous trip&nbsp; ++&nbsp; and what else I can't remember.&nbsp; I think I included a children's book for Gabriel's children.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I really can't tell anybody that my days in New York are dull, and I really felt most alive and happy to have accomplished my task for the day.&nbsp; Just before Bonnie's car pulled out, I gave her a dollar bill for seduka, to help assure her a safe trip.<BR>
<BR>
She and her family impressed me as a nice, gentle group, intelligent and calm, quiet and caring.&nbsp;&nbsp; They received my entry at the very last minute with complete acceptance, and made me feel welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mother did not get overly involved, and her father was straight forward.&nbsp; The mother [<BR>
Sterns ?] asked me where I lived, and when I said Manhattan she asked which subway station.&nbsp; "Cooper Square," I told her.<BR>
<BR>
Apparently I had met Bonnie on my last [or previous] trip, but I remembered the group with the balcony, not the first-floor apartment where she said she lives.&nbsp; Their house is a lovely, older wood paneled townhouse, largely unchanged from the original design.&nbsp; Elderly but charming.&nbsp; A thoroughly nice family: one could do a lot worse.<BR>
<BR>
After I got home, I relaxed for a few minutes and then went to a Shareholder's Meeting in the Lobby.&nbsp; Much Strum und Drang.<BR>
<BR>
Enjoy the items.<BR>
<BR>
Much love,&nbsp; Dad<BR>
