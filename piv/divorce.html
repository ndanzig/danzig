Subject: Nachum asked some questions <br>
 9 Jan 2003
<BR>

Dear Nachum<BR>
<BR>
A]&nbsp;&nbsp; You asked about when the family breakup occurred, and how long I stayed with the commune.&nbsp; I have several very clear memories of how all this happened, but am not exactly sure about the dates.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have written these here, and am sending a copy to your brothers, although they did not requested this, and who may, or, may not, be content to receive it.&nbsp;&nbsp; [This is by way or notifying them, that this contains unsolicited information.]<BR>
<BR>
As for the larger picture, I am very, very sorry that your Mom and I could not have gotten along better, because such splits work serious difficulties on everybody, most of all, the children.&nbsp; I am also very sad that I did not, or, could not have discussed these things at the time, or, closer to the time with you:&nbsp; but you and your brothers have always shown a deep reluctance to open up this issue, perhaps with good reason. <BR>
<BR>
So, I will try to answer Nachum's question as to the dates, but I have some very specific recollections that go deeper.&nbsp; These memories, incidently, do NOT justify my actions, but do show the great divide that existed.&nbsp; I can recall these,&nbsp; if anybody wishes to know more, at this time.<BR>
<BR>
I also wrote up a public account ["Fatherhood and My Rebirth as a Man"] of how I started to become from scratch,&nbsp; 'a custodial parent.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this was published in a book [entitled, "Men in Difficult Times:&nbsp; 1981] I will mail, by separate 'snail mail,' a copy of this short article.<BR>
<BR>
I have consulted my brain, Susan and Elliott, and some records, and the best dates I come up with is this:<BR>
<BR>
My Dad died in February, 1974, and Allan separated from Naomi that year.&nbsp; I came to see that Allen could never have left while Bib was alive.. .. <BR>
<BR>
I was unhappy in my marriage, too, but I did not know how to change [improve] it.&nbsp; I tried many avenues, such as therapy.&nbsp; One weekend your Mom and I went to&nbsp; New York and stayed in a hotel, with little success.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I had never faced making the 'Big Change.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Allan's separation seems, in retrospect, to have emboldened me:&nbsp; the whole world had not ended with his divorce.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
I was into the Men's Movement [suggested by Myrna] which was also emboldening; plus couple's therapy with Carl Drobness, in Montclair&nbsp; [that's where I met Annette Evans and Harold].&nbsp; And then, one day, Myrna suggested that we join a commune.&nbsp; I agreed, thinking, if she had problems with me [too many outside civic committees, not enough helping out at home] then the others would help to shape me up !&nbsp;&nbsp; and, living with others would take her 'off my case.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These others could act as a buffer.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
So sometime in 1974 we joined up with the commune people:&nbsp; it was a way to hold on to the marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; The planning went on for many, many months.&nbsp; Myrna and I also traveled, hopefully, to France and Spain in the summer of 1974.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I found some aspects of that trip unbearable.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, probably in 1975, the commune planning went into its last phases:&nbsp; Susan asked everyone to 'put up or shut up.'&nbsp; That is, bring a deposit on a house to the next meeting, or, don't come.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our friends, Arthur and Judy Goldberg&nbsp; [from the 'Jewish Group']&nbsp; backed out, as did another dozen people, leaving a core.&nbsp; [The Berkowitzes, Jill and Justin plus Steve and the Danzigs.]<BR>
<BR>
Near the end of planning, as we were looking for a place to rent, Myrna told me she was not going to join up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stunned, I paused a moment, then said, "Well, I am going..."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exchange was as simple, opaque and uncommunicative, as that.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Of course nobody at the commune believed me, but I persisted.&nbsp; [I have a vivid memory of how I announced this change to the commune members.]&nbsp;&nbsp; I insisted that the commune find a house within walking distance of Edgemont Road and, over the next six weeks, we did.&nbsp;&nbsp; Myrna became quite upset&nbsp; [of course]&nbsp; and you&nbsp; [Nick]&nbsp; were with me on one occasion when I was loading up the car, as she asked me NOT to have the commune move so close to the Goldberg's, on Midland Avenue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her that that was a decision for the commune to make, and this discussion became heated, and physical.&nbsp; You may have some memory of that.<BR>
<BR>
The deal, as I recall,&nbsp; was this:&nbsp;&nbsp; Myrna would have custodial responsibility for the boys at home, and I would have you just for the weekends [Friday, Saturday and Sunday] and Wednesday.&nbsp; I paid child-support:&nbsp; this arrangement lasted about six months.<BR>
<BR>
Then, sometime later in 1975, or possibly 1976, Myrna said that it was impossible for a woman to make it alone with three kids in the suburbs, and she wanted to move to NYC.&nbsp;&nbsp; She would take over custodial payments to me, and I acceeded to her wishes.&nbsp; Rather than have you-all move into the commune [which was already experiencing difficulties] I moved out, and back into Edgemont Road.&nbsp; I thought it wise NOT to break up your continuity of living at home.<BR>
<BR>
I checked these dates out with Susan and Elliott [they think the commune started&nbsp; early in 1996].&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan stayed there about a full year, when finally, it fell apart.&nbsp; She remembers that when the commune started, Genna was two years old, and Genna is now 29:&nbsp; so this was 27 years ago.&nbsp; I remember that Nick was 6 and Gabriel 14 years old.<BR>
<BR>
I also found some notes of conversations between Myrna and me, and between David Berkowitz and me in my datebook of 1974, relating to this period.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to see these, I can sent them on.&nbsp; They show an unhappy couple trying, unsuccessfully, to work things out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have a memory of how the 'news' was broken to the boys, and how upset you became.<BR>
<BR>
B]&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding your second question, when did Myrna stop teaching and travel to Mexico, I am less certain.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had tried to stay in touch with her, but she joined up with a group of women [some quite noteable, such as the feminist author, Susan Warhoftig, from Cornell].&nbsp;&nbsp; She wished to have very little to do with me, although she continued to see you boys every other weekend, plus dinner on Wednesdays.&nbsp; Her custodial payments to me were no longer forthcoming.<BR>
<BR>
Wednesdays, of course, Myrna visited Montclair, teaching at State College.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew little about her, but learned that she was starting her dissertation on, "Runaway&nbsp; Mothers," for her Ph. D., at Rutgers, The State University, and interviewing women who were pursuing that option.&nbsp;&nbsp; She moved from New York and moved to that lakeside community in northern New Jersey, around this time, if memory serves.&nbsp; It was kind of primitive, and I think she lived there several summers, and one winter.<BR>
<BR>
One September day, perhaps in 1977, or, 1978, I received a phone call from 'Thunder' Haas, formerly Ron, a member of the Education Department at Montclair, and serving as the Chair.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew him as a special friend of your Mom's and listened as he told me&nbsp; that Myrna had missed the Registration and several classes, and, if she did not return to teaching 'next week,' she would be referred for dismissal or suspension.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had little or nothing to answer, and memory fails to reveal how I eventually found out that she was with a group ['convoy,' I was told] of women driving station wagons and vans, who were driving down to Mexico.&nbsp; Sounded pretty adventuresome to me !&nbsp; and therefore unlike the woman I had known.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I did not know how to get in touch with her.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, I never learned how she was reinstated at the College.<BR>
<BR>
C]&nbsp;&nbsp; I am now 67 years old, and have bittersweet memories of my life.&nbsp; Perhaps foremost among the things I wish I could have done differently would be having had some open discussions of these events with my kids, so that these disruptive events could have been understood better.&nbsp; My meager, and clumsy, efforts were always met with understandable resistance, however.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe, and learned, largely from Susan, that almost any difficulty or emotional ache can be softened, if not made to disappear, in time, by talking it over.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, I am taking this opportunity of being asked for some dates by Nachum, to elaborate a little, and to send this response on to Gavriel and Henry, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this does not cause any increased agita, now, after all these years.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
I also found some notes from 1974, as I mentioned,&nbsp; which have the merit of having been written down at the time, should anyone want to see these.<BR>
<BR>
Basically, I am very pleased and proud of what each of you, our sons, are doing with your lives:&nbsp; firmly in chosen fields, with families and/or friends and&nbsp; finding respect in your chosen communities.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is about all any parents can hope for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As your Mom said to me several years ago:&nbsp; "We must have done something right.. .. .."<BR>
<BR>
I am always open to hear the thoughts of each of you, on this or any subject, now, or in the future.<BR>
<BR>
With much love, many wishes for your continued happiness and health, and accomplishments in your work, now and in the years ahead .. .. ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad</FONT></HTML>
