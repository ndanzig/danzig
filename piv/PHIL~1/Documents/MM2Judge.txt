Your Honor


I live at 70 East 10th Street, Manhattan and have been aware for some time of the absence of NO PARKING signs at the curb in front of my residence.   As a result, automobiles and trucks are parked there at various times during the day.  It is my impression that this absence is due to the extensive construction to the front of this building, which is now ending.

I was therefore shocked when Mr. Danzig told me that he had received a parking ticket on the morning of August 25, 1997.   I would like you to know, that as of today's date, October 13, 1997, there are still no NO PARKING signs on this street and that autos frequently park there at any and all times.

I believe that it would be unjust to fine Mr. Danzig, who parked on a street with no restrictive signs.


Sincerely,







Marilyn Miller
