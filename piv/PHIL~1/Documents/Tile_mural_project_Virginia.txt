Dear Mr. De Sevio

	When we spoke last, you indicated that the mural project we were discussing might take a while to come to fruition, if at all.    Having not heard from you, I called your office during the intervening time, and spoke with your associate, Mrs. De Sevio, I believe.   She said that the company you represent had questioned the type of tile that would be used, and were particularly concerned because they felt that glazed tiles might not be appropriate.

	Therefore, I am sending you a set of tile blanks, cut to no particular shape, as a representation of the colors and finishes which could be used.   With the exception of  two brown tiles, they are all matt finish.   These are meant to indicate sample colors only.   In the event talks on an actual mural proceed, the actual colors utilized would surely be subject to discussion.   The range of colors (and finishes) which is available, obviously, is much wider than those I am sending.

	If you have further questions on any aspect of the proposed work, please do not hesitate to contact me.  In any event, I would appreciate hearing from you concerning the progress (or lack thereof) of the proposal.


	Sincerely




Phillip I Danzig  RA
