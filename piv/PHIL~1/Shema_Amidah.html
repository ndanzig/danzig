Thanks for your quick reply, all favorable comments, as I expected.   
However, I think that I owe you some money I promised for the trip, No? 
I sent $500 to Leah for you (+$50 for herself) but didn't your ticket cost $400  +  $150 to
change your own ticket?  plus (how much) for the extra luggage?   Please add it up and let me know....


I have had two thoughts occur to me, recently.   1) Arafat (the murderer) vowed to
 <I>"take back Palestine from the Jews by force of arms"</I> and the Labor party devised a 
simple way to prevent this from ever happening  --  they decided to GIVE him most of it outright ! ! !


2)   The Sabbath service includes the Shema, which (among other things) says that if Israel will
 harken to His commandments, G-d will provide rains and otherwise enrich the lands, and that we, 
in the Amidah, pledge ourselves to rest on the seventh (shivi-i) day.

So it is NOT strange that those in Israel who do NOT observe the Sabbath have no problem with giving up 
much of the land which G-d promised Abraham and his descendents; while those who DO respect the Sabbath 
are wholeheartedly supportive of retaining Greater Israel.    These things go together,don't they?

I am struck that the English (Phoenician) spelling for shivi-i contains the Roman number for seven, vii.


Anyway, good luck with your house search (which I suppose you will combine with a job-search, 
in that a short commute from home to work is a marvelous thing).   I guess you know that Bruce Cohen
 works for a housing agency -- might he have any leads in apartment hunting?

Pleae keep in touch as your plans unfold.

Wishing you good health, sturdy life, abundance and fortitude, and many good times,     
           LOVE        Dad and Marilyn
