<p>The Indespensible and Inspirational Book and Manual, December 12, 2000
</p>
<p>
This book is aimed for the general reader interested in the history of mosaics, but, more specially, for the artist, home crafter or educator who actually wants TO MAKE MOSAICS THEMSELVES. The illustrations are beautiful in their own right, the 'how to do it' drawings on how to cut tile, select subjects, dedcorate flat and curved surfaces (such as teapots !) are inviting, provokative and irresistable. A must read for all those interested in this oldest, most permanent and basically simple, decorative art.
