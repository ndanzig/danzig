Dear Nachum<BR>
<BR>
Frankly, I am bothered that they are taking a week to locate the source, but every one with knowledge tells me that this is normal and correct.&nbsp; I want them to start procedures right away.&nbsp; {Once they start I may feel discomfort, and regret that ! ]<BR>
<BR>
They can be rather sure where to look, however.&nbsp; It seems that when an abnormal cell breaks away and lodges elsewhere, it retains certain 'markings' of its origin.&nbsp; {Some have brown hair, some have RED hair ! ]&nbsp; So, if Red means stomach, and they find a cell with red hair in the intestines, they know the origin.&nbsp; They do not have to look everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
For some reason they are not talking right now about surgery.&nbsp; Perhaps because the cells are isolated, like grains of salt, or stars in the Milky Way, rather than in a big lump.&nbsp; <BR>
Modern medicine, as far as I know, does not think these things heal themselves spontaneously.&nbsp; That is the realm of alternate healing and faith healing, which depend on herbs or prayer, etc., etc., to get results.
<BR>
<BR>
I want to go to Florida and to see you at this time, VERY MUCH.&nbsp; However, they have not set the 'protocol' of therapy, which could be taking something once a week, twice or three times a week.&nbsp; Obviously, THAT will come first.&nbsp; I have three books:&nbsp; one for you and once each for Rachele and Rivkah [on Rachele's class in keeping the home].&nbsp; I have other stuff around also.&nbsp; But I think I will send the books as&nbsp; a fail safe, to Henry.&nbsp; Then, even if I cant make it [which I would regret] you'd get the books.&nbsp; Can you take them ?&nbsp; And the 'Cat' books ?&nbsp; The latter is entirely up to you.<BR>
<BR>
Love&nbsp; Dad<BR>

this news is good - but thing still sound very serious.<BR>
The should still look in other places .&nbsp; It could be in the stomach and <BR>
some where else too.&nbsp; I suppose they can cut out a piece of your stomach.<BR>
will the liver then clean itself up, or do they still need to do chemo?<BR>
<BR>
Also, do you know if you will be able to go to Florida?<BR>
