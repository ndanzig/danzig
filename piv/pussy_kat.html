<h2>DOGGEREL FOR A PUSSY KAT</h2>
<P>
Pussy Katz, Pussy Katz, where have you been?<br>
I've been to Europe for what can be seen.<br>
Pussy Katz, Pussy Katz, what did you there?<br>
I saw the glassmakers displaying their wares.

<p>
Pussy Katz, Pussy Katz, where do you go?<br>
I'm going to Oakland to do what I know.<br>
Pussy Katz, Pussy Katz, what will you do?<br>
I'll concentrate madly and not think of you.

<p>
Pussy Katz, Pussy Katz, will you come East?<br>
I know somebody who will be most pleased.<br>
Pussy Katz, Pussy Katz, I'll make you purr.<br>
By rubbing your tail and by stroking your fur.

<p>
Saramist, Saramist, can I prove worthy?<br>
If I continue to live in New Jersey?<br>
Saramist, Saramist, if near or far<br>
I'll remember forever wherever you are.
