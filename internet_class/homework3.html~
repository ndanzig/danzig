<li>
Create a standard starting web page with html and body tags. Then, read 
Section 2 and 3 of the course sylabus and add to the web page  
each of the  following tags.  Use each at least 3 times. I leave the content 
of the text you write up to you, but it must not be vulgar in any way. Use
 more than one text color.
 Try to figure out what each tag does. (Note: Almost every opening tag also 
has a closing tag.)

<li> Demonstrate the cascade effect by using the three different 
methods of giving a personal style to the p tag. In other words, over-ride
the p tag in 3 different ways and show that the last one takes prescedence.
<br />
Make 2 special classes for the blockquote tag. Define your own margin, font-style, background, background, padding.  This may require about a few minutes of 
internet searching to find an example, but I want you to get in the habit of 
finding information on the Net.
<br />
Over-ride one more tag of your choosing, one that we did not discuss( or you 
may choose the  div or span tags, but then find a new attribute to redefine in it.)
