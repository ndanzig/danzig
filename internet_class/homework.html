Homework Assignments 
</h3>

Do a 4-5 page web site based on a specific topic.  Chose from below. Must be a minimum of 500 words.
Make sure you pages have a consistent layout and color scheme (use CSS to help
ensure this).
The grade will be based on content, design, and demonstrative and creative use
 of the HTML we have taught.
You may also suggest topics not found in the list, but then you must have
 your topic approved by Rabbi. Danzig.  Do not engage in plagiarism.  
That means do not copy information from the web or from books into your page.
You can read other websites, but you must digest and interpret what you read 
before writing anything. At least re-write it in your own words. Hopefully 
your site will become  a source for other people's sites.
