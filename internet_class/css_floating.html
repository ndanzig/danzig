<h2>CSS - Floating</h2>
<p> When positioning text and/or pictures using CSS it is often desired
to have one element stay on the right or left of the other element instead of being beneath the other element.
 The CSS attribute <em>float</em>  helps achieve this goal. The float attribute only 
works with elements whose position is relative.  Absolutely positioned elements will ignore floated
elements.

<p>Here is a list of the possible floating attributes you can use:
<ul>

<li>left -  The element floats to the left
<li>right - The element floats the right
<li>none -  The element is not floated, and will be displayed just where it occurs in the text. This is default
<li>inherit - (Not supported in IE)Specifies that the value of the float property should be inherited from the parent element
</ul>

<p>What is interesting about floating is that if one element takes up less verticle space than the other,
the longer text element will wrap around the smaller. This creates interesting effects.




<p>I will now show an example in which a short newspaper article is kept to the left of a longer article.



<p style="position:relative;  width:1.2in;  float:left;">
Don't let your turtle outsmart you.  Be tough!
</p>
<p style="  width:4in; ">
Once your turtle figures out you bring the food, he or she may be quite excited to see you. And if you don't have food, they sometimes swim back and forth frantically, and manage to look like are starving and need food -- now! Don't let them fool you, though, because obesity can be a big problem in turtles.
</p>

<p>
To get this effect I have made the shorter test position:relative and float:left.  This will cause 
the next paragraph to start at the same height position as the shorter text.  In order to show this clearly I 
adjusted the widths of the paragraphs.
I can adjust the space between the two sets of text using padding. 
<p>
What you should be asking is why does the shorter text start slightly lower than the longer text?
  They should start at the same point.

The answer is that all paragraphs have some default CSS settings that are generally good, but
lead to undesirable behavior when we start playing around with CSS.
I will fix this by setting the margin-top of the shorter paragraph to 0px. (It was previously set to
something like 10 pixels.)  See the source code for this page.


<p style="position:relative;  width:1.2in;  float:left; margin-top:0;">
Don't let your turtle outsmart you.  Be tough!
</p>

<p style="  width:4in; ">

Once your turtle figures out you bring the food, he or she may be quite excited to see you. And if you don't have food, they sometimes swim back and forth frantically, and manage to look like are starving and need food -- now! Don't let them fool you, though, because obesity can be a big problem in turtles.
</p>


<p>I can also have three columns by  adding a third paragraph and making the second one also float:left.
When setting the paragraph width of the third paragraph , bear in mind that the width 
must allow for the other two paragraphs plus the desired width.  Thus if the first two 
paragraphs have a combined width of 5.2 inches, you will need to make the third 
paragraph width  9 inches just to get an effective 3.8 inches to write in.
<p style="position:relative; float:left;  width:1.2in; ">
Don't let your turtle outsmart you.  Be tough!
</p>
<p style="width:3in; position:relative; float:left;  ">

<p style="width:9in; " >
Red eared sliders need a diet that is a mixture of animal and plant material. However, young red eared sliders eat more animal protein so babies are started off on a diet that is more on the carnivorous side. It is still a good idea to offer vegetation to young turtles although they may not really start eating it until they get older (offering it early on at least makes it less likely they will shy away from trying it as they age). For adult red eared sliders, vegetation should make up a significant part of the diet. 
</p>


<p>Here I make the third paragraph width only 6 inches, and I get a text wrap around.


<p style="position:relative; float:left;  width:1.2in; ">

<p>Here I am trying to get the text wrap around with three paragraphs.

<div style="position:relative; float:left; width:4in; ">

<p style="float:left; width:3in;   ">

This paragraph will be floated to the left.  Will that have any affect on it considering it is the last paragraph 
on the page? <b>NO</b>
