<h2>CSS - Pseudo Classes</h2>

Look at this CSS
<pre>
i:hover 
{
font-size:14pt; 
color:red;
}
 
b:first-child
{
border: solid red ;
font-size:14pt;
color:red;
font-weight:normal;
</pre>

<p>
This is <i>italic</i>. And it changes when you hover over it.
<p>
The bold text here has been <b>boxed in red</b>. Because it is the first b tag which is a son of the paragraph<br>
<b>But this text is regular bold because it is the second b tag that is a  son of the paragraph</b>
Note that it is not considered a child of the BR preceding it.
<br>
Were it preded by a p or div or almost any other tag it would become the first child of that tag.
BR is special!!



<p>Some pseudo classes only work on the a tag
<pre>
a:link {color:#FF0000;}      /* unvisited link */
a:visited {color:#00FF00;}  /* visited link */
a:active {color:#0000FF;}  /* selected link */
</pre>
