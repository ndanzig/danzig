   (HTML - HyperText Markup Language)
   A. "Hypertext" is a term created by visionary Ted Nelson
      to describe non-linear writing in which you follow associative paths
      through a world of textual documents. The most common use of hypertext
      these days is found in the links on World Wide Web pages.
