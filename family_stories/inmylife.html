<h2> Some events of My life</h2>
<p>My Bar Mitzvah parsha is Veethchanan.  The same as my father's eventhough his 
solar birthday is 25 days from mine.  And that Parsha we spent together several times,
including once in a hotel in the Catskills where we ate prime rib and listened together
to the kriah.   We had no chumashim in English so I translated for my father.
At one point my fatehr said that my translation sounded familiar.  We realized then that we 
had gotten to the second paragraph of the sh'ma which is in the parsha.


<p>In the school year 1990-91 I spent several shabboses with my father at the Carlebache 
Shul in Manhattan.  Haddassa Carlebach served us spicy gefilte fish.  We saw his
wife and daughters there for dinner.  We had a very late night Seder there. We cleared away all
 liquids when we were about to eat matzah so as not to make gebrukts. After eating the Matzah we
 waited for Shlomo to give everyone a brocha.  We gave up waiting at 4:00 am and went home.  
I also spent a succoth at eth shul.  I slept under the table and saw shlomo come back into the succah late at night to study.  He nodded off to sleep and then returned upstairs to finish
the night's sleep.

<p>My credit card company somehow got the bank number wrong on my account and actually charged 
someone else for my purchases.  Eventually they called me and charged me.

<p>Coincodences: My son Yehoshua fishel ben Nachum Zvi ben Yehoshua Fishel ben Avraham  
was born on June 30, 2007.  His brit was on Shabbat, July 7, 2007. In other words on the 
seventh day of the week, on 7/7/07.  The Mohel's name was Yehoshua also and the Doctor we saw 
afterward was named Philippe.  He was the seventh grandson born to my father in Israel.
We live on Ben Yefuneh Street.  Caleb Ben Yefuneh was Yehoshua's partner in exploring and conquering the land of Israel.  The only two people to survive the desert and make it to Israel from 
Egypt.

<p>
commune had a woman named Jill
 <p>
diggin coal at the commune in the front yard.

<p>
they ate eggplant parmesean which was ok except for the peals.
 <p>
dad had me help him pack when he moved to commune so that I would tangibly know he was moving.  that was his way of telling me he was moving out.  he tried to make it fun.  but I had mixed feelings.  as opposed to mom who just was not home when we came back.  Dad when we moved back explained to me that mom would be leaving.  I was terrible shocked and unhappy that dade was coming home and mom was leaving,  and she did not even tell me.  I liked the people at the commune and had fun there.  though I did not like the eggplant parmisan because of the peels.
 <p>
mom had a green datsun car and some times she came to edgemont school to pick me up and so I looked for the car,  at one point a teacher bought the same car and so I looked for mom but she was not at school.  eventually i learned to ignore the car.  and knew mom was not picking me up.
