<h2> Danzig Stories from Bernard Danzig b. 1937</h2>

<p>
A beautiful old cash register was in the store.  Linda Amster wanted it but Bernard kept it and had it
restored.  It is brass and sits on an oak stand built as one piece. 
The cash register is a non-electric crank type.  




When my father was a child he and his family lived in Midnight, Mississippi and he or his brother would
 take the chickens to Louise to be slaughtered. My mother Sylvia Danzig is also burred in Greenville. 

On the family tree you left out two birth dates Rebecca Altman 1995 and Elisabeth Altman 1997.  
Shirley Martin called me the other day and wanted to talk to Elliott Danzig so I have her his phone number.  
She said she met me.  It must have been when Linda had be over to her apartment to met a bunch of Danzigs. 
 I was so overwhellemed I don't remember anyone.  Hope things are going well.
Bernard

Bernards's father sold his store in 1993 and  left Rolling Fork and went Memphis
 to the home for the aged.   

<p>
Abe'e wife Sophie was  Mayor Sam Rosenthal's  sister. 

<p> The football coach would ask ED Danzig when the Jewish holidays are so he could
could schedule football
 games not to conflict with the holidays because several Jewish boys were on the football team.  


<p> Aunt Rochel and Solomon Levine's store (named Danzig's, probably because HD started it and then gave it to his sister
Rochelle)  was first a dry goods store  selling clothing, shoes, skins (beaver and mink).
Ed bought the business from Levine, but the actual building was never his.  He rented it from an Italian family.

<p>
Then in about 1950 Ed bought a second store for furniture. He kept it locked and opened it on request.  This way he could
run both stores himself.  Ed found that there was a bigger mark-up on furniture and he could make more money in
furniture than dry goods.  So he eventually closed the Danzig dry goods store (the one from Levine).
  The furniture included things like red velvet lamp shades 
and other items catering to local Blacks. Ed actaully became relatively wealthy from this business.  He kept a cigar box
 with money in it behind the couch.  If there was a big sale he took some of the money to his pocket and 
kept it off the books.  He kept a credit book, so that people could buy on credit.  The book was indexed according to 
item and not according to the client's name.  Bernard corrects lthe credit book was done according to the customers name.  

<p> Someone (?) lived in Midnight, Miss. before moving to  Rolling Fork.
<p> Louise, Miss. had a shochet so they (who?) would go by train to there with chickens and come back tha same day.
<p> Buried in the Greenville Jewish Cemetery: Lewis Danzig, Anna Cohen, Solly Cohen, Philip Cohen, Edwin Danzig

Ida Danzig Epstein (Bernard's grandmother) is buried in Memphis.
