<h2> Some events of My life</h2>
<p>My Bar Mitzvah parsha is Veethchanan.  The same as my father's eventhough his 
solar birthday is 25 days from mine.  And that Parsha we spent together several times,
including once in a hotel in the Catskills where we ate prime rib and listened together
to the kriah.   We had no chumashim in English so I translated for my father.
At one point my fatehr said that my translation sounded familiar.  We realized then that we 
had gotten to the second paragraph of the sh'ma which is in the parsha.


<p>In the school year 1990-91 I spent several shabboses with my father at the Carlebache 
Shul in Manhattan.  Haddassa Carlebach served us spicy gefilte fish.  We saw his
wife and daughters there for dinner.  We had a very late night Seder there. We cleared away all
 liquids when we were about to eat matzah so as not to make gebrukts. After eating the Matzah we
 waited for Shlomo to give everyone a brocha.  We gave up waiting at 4:00 am and went home.  
I also spent a succoth at eth shul.  I slept under the table and saw shlomo come back into the succah late at night to study.  He nodded off to sleep and then returned upstairs to finish
the night's sleep.

<p>My credit card company somehow got the bank number wrong on my account and actually charged 
someone else for my purchases.  Eventually they called me and charged me.

<p>Coincodences: My son Yehoshua fishel ben Nachum Zvi ben Yehoshua Fishel ben Avraham  
was born on June 30, 2007.  His brit was on Shabbat, July 7, 2007. In other words on the 
seventh day of the week, on 7/7/07.  The Mohel's name was Yehoshua also and the Doctor we saw 
afterward was named Philippe.  He was the seventh grandson born to my father in Israel.
We live on Ben Yefuneh Street.  Caleb Ben Yefuneh was Yehoshua's partner in exploring and conquering the land of Israel.  The only two people to survive the desert and make it to Israel from 
Egypt.
