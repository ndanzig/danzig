<h2> Danzig Stories from Elliot Danzig b. 1917</h2>

<p>

My Dad's father (Itch) came from Russia to New York City when he was about 87. 
My father took to meet him (in NY) when I was about 9 years old.  
He spoke to me in Yiddish and asked me if I spoke Yiddish.  I answered with the only phrase I knew :
 Hock me nish con chinic(sp?) which  
Dad later explained meant "don't bother my head." ( the yiddish literally means, "Quit banging the tea pot.")  
 
I never saw my grandfather again.  I understand he lived to be about 92, and  spent his time enjoying
classical music and going to shul.


<p>I also remember visiting uncle Bib and being impressed with his high standard of living.  He took me to the 1939 world
fair. He was a charming man, who lived in the same building as Eleanor Roosevelt. 

<p>My father was Abraham Danzig and after being fired by his uncle HD for trying to unionize HD's factory workers
he went to Rolling Fork, Miss.  There he Married Sophia Frieda Rosenthal, the sister of Sam Rosenhtal, the Mayor of RF.
She was a nurse and also opened various stores to try to support the family while Abe tried to help in the store, but
he was not very good at it.
 <p> Sophia lost twins at birth and 12 years later had a son, Elliot. Abe, my father, was a gambler and often did quite well
thus we lived sometimes very well, and others without any money.  My mother's nursing work help us get by.  But this 
lead to tension in the family and eventually my parents separated and at the age of fifteen, I was left for six months
 with the family of the local sherrif.  
This trauma lead me to invest a lot of energy into the world or reading.
<p>Eventually, Edwin told Abe to open a beer joint with dominos, a pool table, and food in the back for black people.
They also set up gambling there, and the sheriff also gambled there, along with judges and the like.  The sheriff suggested
that the house take a cut.  This proved to be a success, and the family was reunited and financial problems were overcome.
This sheriff went on to become the governor of Arkansas(?) and invited my father and mother to visit the governor's 
mansion.
