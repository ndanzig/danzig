  <LI>Write a program in C  with a menu like this:
  <br>(1) run "vmstat 1" via execv and fork
  <br>(2) run "vmstat 1" via system
  <br>(3) run "ping 147.161.16.10" via execv and fork
  <br>(4) run "ping 147.161.16.10" via system
  <br>(5) run "ps -aux " via system
  <br>When the user make a selection, do the action he requested and then return and give him a menu again.


<br><br>  <li>Demonstrate IPC <br> 
  Write a program in C to do the following:
  <br>open a text file (you'll have to create a text file using emacs or whatever)
  <br>read the file into a buffer of size 200 bytes 
  <br>write the buffer into a shared pipe 
  <br>have a child process read from the pipe each packet and write it to a 
<b>new</b> file.

<br><br><li>
Create a parent process and two child processes. Have the child processes
send messages to the father by writing strings to shared memory.  To prevent 
the parent from getting two different childs' messages at the same time, 
use a semaphore to control the childs' writing to the memory.
Also, use some kind of random waiting method so that the children will write
at random (and potentially conflicting) times.  The strings that the children write
should be hard-coded in ( make an array of strings ) and can be of your 
choosing.  However, they should indicate which child is writing and which time he 
is writing (e.g. "child 1 first time", "child 1 second time", ....)

<br><br><li>You are asked to create one pipe to be used as a communication exchange.
A parent process creates 3 child processes. It will signal which child is
to listen on the pipe at which time.  The parent process will allow the
user to choose to which process he wants to send a message.  
<p>
The user will be able to send a text message to any son he wants through 
the pipe common to all processes.  The user will be able to kill any child 
he desires, and at any time.  The program will keep running until the user
 kills all the 3 child processes.
<p>
If user types 'quit' you must kill all children before exiting (otherwise they
 will not die until the system comes down).
Do the same if the user types control-c (note: use a trap on control-c). 
<p>
Also the father may send signals other than -KILL (-9) to the children.
Implement 3 such signals (in addition to INT) of your choice. 
'man 7 signal'  will list for you all the signals.

<p>
<br>Sample input and output:
<br>>
<br>> 1 hello 
<br>son 1: hello
<br>> 3 hello
<br>son 3: hello
<br>> 1 kill -KILL
<br>father: son 1 terminated.
<br>> 1 hello
<br>father: son 1 no longer alive.
<br>> 3 hello
<br>son 3: hello 
<br>> 3 kill -KILL
<br>father: son 3 terminated.   
<br>> 2 kill -KILL
<br>father: all sons died. Bye.
<br>>
<br>>
