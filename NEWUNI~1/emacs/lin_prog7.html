<h3><u>and yet more emacs</u></h3>
At this point we should mention <big>C-/</big> which is the undo option
it will undo <br>
the last act. You can do several of these in a row. <br> 
<big>C-x u</big> Is also undo (and sometimes the only option).<br>
Notice there is a big difference between <big>C-x u</big> and <big>C-x C-u</big>
 you must let go of the Ctrl key, <br>
before hitting the u key.   <br>
<br>
Handeling files and buffers can be done with menus on top but with shortcuts:<br>
Opening a file is with <big>C-x C-f</big> you can use the tab to complete
file names <br>
as you can in the bash/tcsh command prompt.  <br><br>
When executing emacs from the command line you can give it a file name as
a parameter, <br>
in both cases should the file not exist emacs will create one.  <br>
<br>
Saving is done by <big>C-x C-s</big> which saves the current buffer(file)
or <br>
<big>C-x s</big> which will prompt to verify and save each and every open
buffer.  <br>
<br>
One exits  emacs with <big>C-x C-c</big>.  <br>
