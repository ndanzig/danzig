<h3><u>more valgrind</u></h3>
valgrind does not require special compilation, you  simply execute like so:
<big>valgrind --num-caller=15 progname<br>
</big>it will run the  program progname, and intercept calls to malloc/free/new/delete
and monitors  all memory uses,<br>
<br>
valgrind is good only for x86s running some Non-ancient  linux, this shouldn't
be much of a problem.  <br>
valgrind will report several  types of errors:  <br>
* Illegal read / Illegal write errors. <br>
* Use of uninitialized   values. <br>
* Illegal frees. <br>
* Inappropriate deallocation function. <br>
* Passing   system call parameters with inadequate read/write permissions.
 <br>
<br>
valgrind  will when possible tell you where in your code relevant memory
blocks were  allocated/freed.  <br>
valgrind is most probably not installed on the linux-box  you are working
on, however installation is trivial and<br>
fairly quick: download,  unpack and then run one after another:<br>
&nbsp;./configure <br>
make <br>
make install  <br>
<br>
valgrind  manual available in SUB_DIR/docs/index.html
