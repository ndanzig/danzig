<h3>Tastes like crap; But, it's good ! </h3>

Three guys go camping, but none like to cook.<br>
So Murry offers to cook, "But if you complain, I quit and <br>
the guy who
complains has to cook."<br>
<br>
Murry cooks two days, gets tired.<br>
Burns the toast. Slimy eggs.<br>
The two other guys LOVE HIS COOKING !<br>
<br>
NOTHING HE DOES TURNS THEM OFF.<br>
<br>
Finally, they camp in a cow field, and Murry is frustrated.<br>
Next morning, he finds a suitable example of 'cow flop,'<br>
cracks an egg over it and fries it up.<br>
Serves it to the other two guys.<br>
<br>
One takes a bite out of it, <br>
his face grimaces in disgust and he spits it out !<br>
"Tastes like shit," he says. Then,.. <br>
smiling bravely, adds, <br>
"But It's GOOD ! ! "
