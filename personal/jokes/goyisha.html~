<h3>Och, Goyisha Kopf </h3>

A Jewish guy, Murry, has always been a good Jew.  He came to synagogue
every week, had friends there.  One day he decides he wants to convert.
His friends try, but cannot dissuade him.
So finally he converts. <br>
The next shabbos, there he is in shul again! <br>
His friends go over to him, "Murry, what are you doing here? You converted!<br>
You should be in Church! " <br>
Says Murry striking his hand to his head, "Och, goyisha kopf!"
