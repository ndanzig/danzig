<h2>Pekudei</h2>

<p>



The parsha starts with an anouncement that the listing of the donations to the mishkan is forthcoming.
The word mishkan is repeated twice.  Rashi writes taht the word is written twice to hint to the two 
temples that were destroyed.  Why doe sthe word mishkan (tabernacle) hint to the Temple?
Well, the obvious reason is that the Temple ultimately replaces the Mishkan. But Rashi gives a different reason.
He writes that the word mishkan is derived from the word mashkon which means a pledge, as in the 
sort of pledge one leaves with a pawn broker when pawning something.  

<p>The hint is therefore that the Temple (here called a mishkan) is only  temporarilly in our posession
and can be taken back by G-d at any time. Just as a person can redeem his pledge 
from the pawn broker, G-d can take away the Temple.  He did this two times in fact.  This seems to mean that the 
mishkan is G-d conditional dwelling place in the world. G-d has chosen to be among 
us but can also choose to leave us if we disobay His laws.  The very essence of his residing among us is 
conditional from the start.  This relates in some way to the theory of Ibn Pekudah that hThshiT  Notati.ik0s mishkan is really a tempfp   W,
