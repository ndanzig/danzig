Dear Nahum:

Abie and I arrived safely in NY, and ate a fabulous dinner prepared specially 
for us by one of our relatives.  Then we figured out how to put the floppy 
drive into her computer.  And now we are sending you a copy of her memoirs.

How did the class go?  GIve my regards to my children when you see them.  
Best wishes,

Gabriel

Memoirs 

I awoke from the lethe of infancy in a green metal crib upstairs in my 
bedroom in our house on Birchall Road in Toledo, Ohio.  This must have been 
1939 when  I was 4. My mother was downstairs playing maj jong with her 
girlfriends and I was left awake and alone in the crib.  I had as a blanket a 
hand knitted  afghan orange, brown, green and yellow.  I didn't care for the 
colors, but it was soft and I tried to arrange it in my bed the way other 
beds were made. I had little luck first of all because I was in the bed and 
second because the bed had immovable sides and so I couldn't tuck the sheet 
in under the mattress.  This type of crib no longer exists, I have never even 
seen them in flea markets or antique stores. While I lay there amusing myself 
I noticed a mole on my thigh.  Its color made me think it might be a drop of 
chocolate so I tasted it, but it was without flavor. I put my finger in my 
mouth to wet it and tried again but I realized what I had really already 
known, that it was not anything to eat. How I got out of bed, who came for me 
I do not remember.

Later probably during the same year, I had what I  much later learned was my 
existential moment.  I walked around our block by myself and looked around.  
I don't know if my mother knew that I was gone but I was alone and I thought 
to myself, I am a self I am independent.  I am told and I do not remember 
this at all, that I walked out of our family apt on a busy street in Toledo 
one Sunday morning while my parent were still sleeping and was found by a 
policewoman who somehow found my parents. Many times as a child I wandered 
away from the beaten track and got lost.  Once I was really lost and feared 
that I could not get home when a tough but kindly bus driver gave me a ride 
to a street from which I knew how to get home. Any other time that I wandered 
I quickly found the way home.

I was a very independent child and also extremely educable.  I learned how to 
ride a two-wheeler in the following way.  My cousin, Dolores, had a small 
bike that she had outgrown and she didn't know whether to give it to me or to 
my cousin Zale who was one year older than I and who was a boy.  Because I 
wanted the bike so badly and had no notion that my parents would buy me on I 
began to practice on my brother's big bike.  He, Harland, was 4 years older 
than I, so you can imagine how big the bike was.  I was five at this time.  I 
had not yet gone to any school.  So somehow I got on Harland's bike and 
taught myself to ride.  At the contest I rode easily and Zale fell off so I 
got the bike. Being the oldest child in that family, he did not have access 
to a big bike as I did so I guess he wasn't able to practice.  I just thought 
he was a spas.  I thought my brother was too.  More on that later.  Winning 
the bike was my triumph.  I felt confidant of my abilities and thought I 
could do anything.  Was this the beginning of narcissim?  When I was older 
and my brother and I went to the same school, Whittier Elementary,  One day 
on the way home I caught him and threw him off his bike and rode it home 
myself.  I so didn't want to walk home.  Nothing was ever said about my 
behavior but it never happened again.

This brings me to the subject of my parents.  They were very little involved 
in our upbringing.  My father went to work every day and even Sat, morning 
and he was otiose anyway and my mother, his slave, was always busy cooking.  
So we were ignored and basically gained our own wisdom whatever it was. They 
fed us, housed us, bought us enough clothes, barely, and took us places on 
occasion.  They stayed home most of the time however so we received little 
stimulation of any kind.  Luckily we had an extended family and aunts, 
uncles, cousins and grandparents when they were alive were very important.  
They were our only social contacts except at school and they helped us a lot 
in various ways.

My uncle Harold was particularly involved with us.  He was my mother's 
brother and they liked each other.  My father of course belittled Harold as 
was his wont with everyone and therefore was friendless as my mother became 
after several years of living with him.  He had a money problem.  He hated to 
spend it and so even though he earned a good living we lived economically to 
put it mildly.  His cheapness caused severe ruptures with the friends they 
had had before they were married and they wound up alone except for their 
families. So Uncle Harold came over frequently and played with me and when he 
married at the age of 40 his wife, Mary who was childless, took us on.  She 
was a school teacher, first grade and on the second greatest day of my life, 
the first being the bicycle contest, she took me to school with her.  I was 5 
and the kids in the class were 6.  Well they all doted on me and I was the 
center of attention a place I very much like to be.  She told my mother who 
was oblivious to us as anything but her progeny that I was smart and I heard 
it and so I knew I was smart and that I was physically adept at a young age.
My parents were the children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants.  My mother was 
born in Toledo the last of four children, two others had died in Europe. Her 
mother had been left in Europe while my grandfather fleeing the Czar's army 
came to this country.  After some time he sent for her and she crossed the 
ocean with her two children, Pesah who became Bessie and Heschel, my uncle 
Harold.  He had a beautiful tenor voice although only six or so and during 
the trip while they were still on land they stopped at an inn.  Russian 
soldiers were there too and for some reason they asked him to sing.  And 
indeed he did, he sang a revolutionary song.  My grandmother was terrified 
thinking she would be arrested, but the soldiers just laughed and that was 
the end of it.  Harold wore a sailor suit like any middle-class Russian child 
and Bessie and Grandma were dressed in the highest Gibson Girl fashion, 
according to a picture I have.  Grandma said that when she arrived in New 
York and was met by her relatives she thought they looked like the 
greenhorns, so well put together were she and her children.  She sewed 
everything they wore and according to my mother she was an excellent 
seamstress. This trait did not pass on to me or to my mother.  I have still 
embroidered pillow cases from her trusseau, A. E.  Anna Eberlin.
Mother was the second child born in America, her sister Jeanette was the 
first, but Grandma had gas for the first time during the delivery and before 
she went out she said goodbye to everyone fearing she would never return to 
conscious life.  But she did of course and Lillian was born and thrived. She 
related to me many times how happy her childhood had been.  There were some 
minor problems such as my uncle Harold didn't want to study Torah or go into 
my grandfather's business.  Grandfather was in the barrel and bag business in 
the days when commodities like pickles and herring came in barrels.  He 
delivered these and large feed bags and bags for flour, grain and whatever to 
stores around town with a horse and wagon.  Supposedly he had done something 
similar in Europe and had been thrown by the horse and punctured a rib.  This 
was later thought to have been the cause of the lung cancer which killed him 
when I was six.  He had also smoked black Russian cigarettes when still in 
the old country.  They couldn't have helped his lungs either, although 
failing to find this type of smoke in America he gave up smoking all 
together.  Grandpa came from an even smaller town than Grandma, Ponadel, and 
my mother said that grandma made fun of him for that.  She came from Ponevez 
a center of Jewish learning and culture totally wiped out by the Nazis in 
1941, but more of that later.
  My memories of Grandpa are few.  He had a large mustache and wore a vest 
with a gold watch in one pocket and a gold chain and fob connecting it to a 
buttonhole.  We sometimes sat on the glider on his front porch and he would 
take out the watch and let me listen to it ticking.  I have that watch today, 
but it doesn't tick anymore.  In 1939 when my conscious memory begins my 
parents left me for a few days with my grandparents while they and my brother 
went to the world's fair in New York.  I had a wonderful time.
My grandparents home was much calmer than mine.  They seemed at peace with 
one another.  Grandpa must have been retired already because I don't think he 
went to work.  We all ate breakfast together. He drank tea out of a glass 
with a piece of sugar in his mouth. They both spoke Yiddish so I have no idea 
what they talked about, but they each wore a kind of cardigan sweater that 
all old people at that time wore.  It was a blend of brown and black and very 
wooly.  Grandma ate an apple by cutting it in pieces with a small sharp 
paring knife.  I can still see her standing by the basement door in her 
cardigan eating an apple.  I felt protected by them as I didn't by my 
parents.  They seemed to be in control and know what they were doing.
I always was a tomboy and during this my only stay with them I got a big sore 
on my knee from rolling around on an ottoman or from the carpet, in any case 
when I woke up the next morning my pyjama leg was stuck to my knee at the 
scab.  I was very frightened.  I thought someone would just rip it off and it 
would really hurt and it would start bleeding and wouldn't heal for a long 
time.  So I went downstairs and showed them what had happened.  I expected 
they would start screaming and not know what to do, but instead they said I 
should go upstairs and tell the maid to put warm water on it until the pants 
came free.  This I did and everything worked out perfectly.  Halfway up those 
stairs there was a swinging door, I assume to keep the heat from escaping 
upwards, but I was fascinated by it since we had nothing of the kind.  I 
liked their house which seemed very big to me.  It had an ice room off the 
kitchen where the icebox had been and which was very cold.  The refrigerator 
took the place of the icebox sometime before I was born, but I still have 
vague memories of it.
In the basement they had an old wind up upright victrola and many opera 
records. My cousin Zale and I used to play down there and wind up the old box 
and listen to the records.  We were fascinated that without electricity there 
could be music.  Also in the basement were large pottery crocks in which 
Grandma made pickles and kvass.  The pickles were delectable but I never 
tasted the kvass.  Mother told me that when she was a little girl she was 
sent to the corner bar with a pail to get beer.  
They also had a three car garage, it must have been a stable at one time.  
When my mother was in high school she told me she had a terrific party in 
these garages.  I was always fascinated by my mother's life before she 
married my father.  She seemed like another person, a person who had fun, who 
did things.  A person who had a ton of friends.   And in fact this was 
verified by my Aunt Bessie who told me that my mother had been charming and 
vivacious and full of fun before she married my father.  I always blamed my 
dad for destroying my mother's life.
In those garages my grandfather kept a Packard and when he worked a wagon.  
The Packard had jump seats in the back and in order for everyone to fit in 
they put a breadboard between the seats.  Mother being the youngest sat on 
the board.  I always think of them going out for a drive in their new Packard 
laughing and singing and mother on the board.  Grandpa did well in this 
country.  He was partners with my grandmother's nephew, the son of her oldest 
sister who was approximately her age.  His name was Willy Horwitz and my 
mother was very friendly with his daughters when she was growing up.  Willy's 
son and grandson still own the business Horwitz and Pintis Barrels and Bags.  
Now they sell steel drums and vats.  My last memory of Grandpa was at a 
seder.  I was probably six.  Grandma was born on the night of the first seder 
so at seder we always also celebrated her birthday.  I don't remember the 
seder at all although I do remember Grandma dressed up welcoming us to her 
house.  It went on a long time and a cup of wine was put out for  Elisha 
which no one drank.  When we left Grandpa was still sitting at the dining 
room table with his yarmulka on praying.  Soon after that he got sick and we 
used to visit him at his home and I heard that the doctor came and drained 
his lungs.  But we the children stayed downstairs and didn't see him.  When 
he died Zale and I played under the sideboard in the dining room with cars or 
something.  I knew things were going on around me, but I was involved in the 
play.
After Grandpa died some big decisions had to be made.  Where and on what was 
Grandma going to live.  She could not live alone they thought.  It was 
decided that Uncle Harold and his new bride, Aunt Mary who is still alive at 
this writing, would move into the house.  Mary taught first grade and Harold 
was a furniture salesman.  I went to their wedding which was at my Aunt 
Bessie's house.  It was fun and Harold played with me.  He sat me on his lap 
and gave me a tweezers to pull out the white hairs in his eyebrows.  At each 
pull he would make a big scene of how much it hurt and that was the fun.  It 
seems strange to me now that he would do this on his wedding day, but that's 
how I recall it.  He was forty years old when he married and supposedly had 
been quite the wild kid until then.  Grandpa had a monitor installed on the 
Packard so it wouldn't go over 40 to keep Harold from speeding.  He was also 
a ladiesman .  When he was young he had black curly hair and everyone called 
him Curly, but by the time he got married he was bald.  Mary was great and 
they had a good although childless marriage.  Grandma lived with them or they 
with her only a short time and then Aunt Jeanette, Uncle Sammy and their two 
kids sold their house in a better neighborhood and moved back to what was 
called the old west end.  Zale was one of their children.  They had all lived 
together before when Grandpa was alive because during the depression Sammy 
didn't make enough money at the newspaper, The Toledo Blade where he was in 
circulation, to afford their own place.  Zale remembers Grandma and Grandpa 
much more than I.
In any case mother had a good time as a child.  She played with all the other 
children of immigrants who had Yiddish names that mother in later years found 
amusing.  Still in elementary school she found a hundred dollars under a 
cobblestone and took it to the police.  They told her she could keep it if no 
one claimed it and no one did.  The cobblestone was in a little square where 
there were public fountains for horses.  It was still in existence though not 
in use when I was a child. She also encountered anti-Semitism.  Some boy 
called her a dirty Jew and she reported him to the principal of her school 
who reprimanded him.  Mother in those days was a feisty little kid.  She told 
me that they had soup and soup meat every night except Friday.  She found 
this terrifically boring.  On Friday they had chicken, what else.  When she 
became a wife she always cooked interesting and different meals and baked 
wonderful cakes, pies and cookies.  
In high school she was an excellent student.  She particularly excelled in 
Spanish and went on to take it in college.  She had a lot of dates and even 
went out once with a shagits.  She told me that once she was necking in the 
car with a boy, maybe the shagits, it was so cold that she froze her feet.  
She met my father at a wedding.  He was handsome and well dressed.  She was 
there with her sister, Jeanette who was 18 months older and with whom she was 
inseparable.  My father noticed Jeanette who had on a bright acqua dress so 
he and a friend went over to meet them and Daddy realized that mother was the 
more attractive so he concentrated on her and left his friend with Jeanette.
After mother died I found her diary for the years, 1927-28.  In it she 
described the period during which Dad courted her.  She really didn't want to 
get married, but he did.  She thought she was too young.  She was 18-19.  She 
was a senior in high school and a freshman in college.  He really pushed her, 
going with his parents to her parents to arrange the marriage.  The parents 
were in agreement and so my mother dropped out of college where she was 
studying to by a gym teacher and married Morris Britz whom she referred to as 
Mor.  He was five years older than she and had just graduated from the 
University of Michigan Law School.  He was in private practice with his 
sister, Sally,  Britz and Britz.  According to him she was so lively that the 
judges gave her many cases just because they liked her and that's what really 
set him up in practice.
This brings me to my father.  His parents were also immigrants.  His mother, 
Leah came from Poland from a family so poor that they sent her to live with 
an uncle in Liverpool, Uncle Asher.  Grandpa came from Memel and also wound 
up in England.  He came from a large family all of whom did very well there 
but he couldn't find work so he came to this country where he finally 
prospered.  He married Grandma in England and they had three children there, 
Morris, my father the oldest, Sally next and then Max.  There had been 
another daughter, Molly but she died before they came to this country.
Grandpa was called Dave but we found out after his death when my parents 
wanted to name my sister after him, that his real name was Benjamin, so my 
sister became Barbara.  I loved Grandpa.  Everyone loved him.  He was the 
exact opposite of my father, although my father and he were very close.  Dad 
must have taken after Grandma.  Anyway Grandpa left Grandma and the three 
kids in London and came here to engage in some kind of business with someone 
he knew.  He didn't contact Grandma and didn't send for her.  They were the 
biggest mismatch you could imagine.  She was sour.  She was also religious 
following all the rules for kashrut, but not spiritual in any way that I 
could ascertain.  She would never eat at our house because we weren't kosher 
and we were never invited to her house to eat. He a was fun loving, hard 
drinking atheist. Anyway Grandma didn't know what to do about being abandoned 
so she sought advice from Uncle Asher and he told her to get in touch with 
her husband which somehow she did and eventually she came to this country.  
In her youth she was a very beautiful woman, all the Britzes were good 
looking, but when I knew her she was just an old grandmother.
My father and his family came across the ocean on The Majestic from Liverpool 
to New York.  During the whole voyage Grandma did not allow her family to eat 
any food except what she brought with them.  It was at least a fourteen day 
trip, but she didn't want them to eat traife.  When they arrived at Castle 
Garden they were met by New York relatives and they stayed in the Lower East 
Side for a while.  My father told me that he was very wild then and used to 
run up and down the stairs of the tenement with a knife.  Grandpa wrote them 
to take a train to a small town in Illinois where he had a dry cleaning 
business.  They came and as soon as they got there he told them they were 
leaving and going to Indianapolis.  It seems his business had failed.  He 
hadn't known how to dry clean and he washed everything.  One man's white 
flannel suit came back fit for a child so Grandpa packed his bags and left 
for another venture that he had heard about.  All of these arrangements were 
through relatives and friends of relatives who were also trying to make it in 
the land of plenty.
They lived in Indiana for six years until my father graduated from grade 
school. I think Grandpa was in the auto parts business there, but I'm not 
sure of that.  In any case they left there and moved to Toledo where Daddy 
started high school and Grandpa opened an auto parts and auto glass store 
where Daddy worked after school and on weekends.  Daddy loved to work at the 
store as we always referred to it and didn't want to go to law school.  He 
wanted to run the store, but his father forced him to go to Ann Arbor going 
so far as to drive him to the train and waiting while my father boarded.  
Daddy came home every weekend because he liked his mother's cooking so much 
and because he could work in the store.
They lived in a big old house where Grandma was the ideal Jewish housewife, 
cooking and cleaning.  Grandpa used to say that when they were going out 
somewhere they would always have to wait for Grandma who was cleaning the 
stove.  Eventually they moved to a house on Rockingham Terrace where I first 
knew them.  This house was on an oval off a busy street and strange as it may 
seem my Aunt Bessie lived just around the other side of the same street.
Daddy told me that the only way he got through high school was that his 
sister, Sally or as he referred to her Sarkie, her real name was Sarah, read 
him all the assignments.  She was one or two years younger, but Grandma kept 
him back so they could be in the same class.  In elementary school they had 
permission to leave the room and go out in the playground when the Lord's 
prayer was read.  Grandma didn't want them contaminated.  The big meal was 
lunch and everyone including Grandpa came home for that.  My father was a 
dutiful son, but I don't think he liked his mother that much.  He always said 
that she had favored Max who continued to eat at her house after he was 
married.  Grandma would cook special dishes for him because she claimed he 
had a sensitive stomach.  I was there, although not invited to eat, for one 
of these meals.
While still in Indianapolis my father his Max with a bat accidentally when 
they were playing baseball.  As a result Max who was the exception to the 
rule that Britzes were good looking had a broken nose all his life.  Max and 
Morris all named after the same person, Malcha Baraks Grandpa's mother were 
very infrequently friendly.  They had an animosity that really surfaced when 
they both were practicing law and competing for the same clients.  Daddy 
always said that Max was unscrupulous and I really never knew who was at 
fault.  On the few occasions when they were friends, they were the funniest 
team around, but these occasions were rare in the extreme.  Max's wife, my 
Aunt Toots, who is also still alive, told me recently that Grandma didn't 
think she was Jewish because she wasn't eastern European, didn't speak 
Yiddish and called the synagogue a church. Once when she complained to 
Grandma that Max didn't know how to put in storm windows, Grandma replied, "I 
didn't send him to law school to learn how to put in storm windows."
Grandpa sent all his children to law school even Aunt Sally.  They also all 
had violin lessons.  None of them were very good and Daddy was politely asked 
to absent himself from the school orchestra when he was a boy.  Grandpa 
wanted his children to prosper and not have to do menial work.  Toledo was 
kind to him and his store really took off and he even opened another one in 
Monroe, Michigan.  But Grandpa spent all his money on others and when he died 
really an untimely death he was sixty-five he didn't leave Grandma very much, 
but then they hadn't been living together for many years.  He lived in Miami, 
had a bar and motel in Opa Loka and she lived on the beach.  
He did keep in touch with his relatives in England, however, and he and 
Grandma went to visit them in July, 1934.  By then he was an American 
citizen.  I have their passport in my apartment and he looks well to do with 
a gold watch chain in his lapel. He was very short according to this 
passport, 5'1", but he did not have the usual short man's macho syndrome.  He 
coughed a lot and had a throaty voice.  I think he had asthma or something 
and he smoked.  In 1942 we took a bus down to visit him in the middle of the 
winter because we didn't have a good car and couldn't get one and he had a 
pretty new Oldsmobile which he didn't need because he was alone and could use 
a smaller car.  It was the middle of the war and one couldn't get cars or 
gasoline for that matter.  The bus trip was interesting.  I met a very cute 
sailor on the bus and I slept on his lap.  I loved him.  We had to get off 
the bus somewhere in the South and there was a huge crowd waiting for this 
one bus and the bus driver motioned to us to get on the bus even though we 
were in the middle of the crowd and no where near the front.  The rest of the 
crowd was Black.  It was my first exposure to institutionalized racism also.  
I drank at the colored fountain, not realizing that there were such 
distinctions coming from the north.  We were really happy to get on that bus 
also because it was very cold in the station.  We stayed with my grandfather 
in one of his cabins and I slept on pillows on the floor.  Every night as I 
was going to bed a cute soldier from the airbase nearby would bring me a 
Squirt from my grandfather's bar.  This was the most delicious drink in the 
world to me.  I was also happy for the attention which I didn't get much of 
at home.  
The servicemen at the bar loved grandpa too.  They all talked about what a 
great guy he was.  The car was a blue Oldsmobile sedan with a kind of hatch 
back.  The paint on the roof was burnt a bit because grandpa said it got very 
hot there in Sept. and Oct.  This was a new fact for me and I loved knowing 
it.  Somehow I felt my parents never gave me any facts.  Grandpa had a black 
coupe with only a front seat so I had to lie on the shelf below the back 
window Grandpa used to call it the self.  He'd say okay Myrna get on the 
self.  It was very cute and we all laughed over it.  For some reason I don't 
remember my brother on this trip.  Grandpa made oatmeal for us every morning 
and I was very surprised because I had never seen a man cook or serve food.  
He had cockroaches too but he explained them away by blaming it on the 
tropical weather.
We drove home in our new car and stopped on the way to pick up a palm frond.  
Unfortunately with it unbeknownst to us came a swarm of red ants.  They 
covered the whole back seat and we didn't know what to do so Daddy took the 
frond which had a rough edge and brushed them all out.  He was my hero that 
day.  
He proved my hero on one other day back in Toledo.  My aunt Sally and her 
husband, Heinie went away for a weekend and they left my cousin Alan with us. 
 Alan was maybe five.  He was very attached to a blanket which he called his 
'bankie' and he couldn't fall asleep without at least some remnant of it.  
But aunt Sally for some reason neglected to leave 'bankie' with us and when 
it came time to go to bed Alan started crying for 'bankie' and we didn't know 
what to do.  So Daddy said okay you don't want to go to bed, well we all are 
and he turned off the lights and we all went to bed including Alan.  I think 
that was the night that he gave up 'bankie'.
But aside from these occasions when the rest of us were helpless Daddy was 
not much fun.  He was terrifically ego-centric and would regale us every 
night with court doings and cases.  None of us ever got a chance to say 
anything and if we did it was just a quick quip.  I owe my inability as  an 
adult to talk in paragraphs to this autocrat at the dinner table. He was also 
very vain and loved to be complimented, but I don't remember his ever 
complimenting one of us.  After Grandpa died of some kind of cancer, I think 
it was renal, I never enjoyed being with my father's family preferring my 
maternal side for socializing.
When I was very young, maybe 3 or 4 at my grandparents' house on Rockingham 
terrace in which there was a very large living room my father picked me up 
over his head and threw me around to the glee of the assorted relatives.  
This is the only time I remember his giving me any affection. It was there 
that I experienced my first social humiliation.  I was 5.  I was sitting on 
the couch nestled in my mother's arms sucking my thumb happily enjoying the 
company of adults when my aunt Sally out of the blue said something like how 
come a big girl like you is still sucking her thumb.  I started to cry and 
nothing could stop me.  I cried and cried for a very long time.  Finally aunt 
Sally came up to me and told me she had something very nice for me in the 
kitchen.  She picked me up and carried me to the kitchen placing me on the 
tile counter which felt cold to my tush. Then she brought out a delicious 
chocolate cake and gave me a big piece. She asked if I was still mad at her 
and I said no but I thought why hadn't she offered the cake to all of us.  
Pretty good for 5.  But I never really trusted her again as she had a habit 
of making fun of people.  Only much later when she was in her 90's did I 
forgive her for my first betrayal.  In the hospital two days before she died 
she told me she loved me and I felt the same.
Nothing could stop me from sucking my thumb.  My mother tried everything.  
She put pepper on it, she bought a rubber thumb and attached it to my thumb, 
but I got it off right quick.  My parents were afraid that my teeth would 
stick out if I kept sucking, but suck I did until I was 12, then I just 
stopped on my own.  But in truth they made my life miserable over it and when 
my own youngest son turned out to be a thumb sucker too, I just ignored it 
and he stopped at 12 just as I had.  Anyway I used to hide my thumb sucking 
behind a book I was reading.  There was no greater pleasure for me than 
reading and sucking.  I did this in school, at home and even in shul where I 
concealed my book inside the Hebrew prayer book which interested me not at 
all.  I remember reading, Freddy the Pig right through the high holy days.  
But I haven't explained how I learned to read.
The year I was five 1940 the Toledo school board decided to eliminate 
kindergarten.  My mother who didn't want to spend the money to send me to a 
private kindergarten, enrolled me in first grade without any documentation of 
my age.  She told me to tell the teacher and anyone else who asked that I 
didn't know when my birthday was, but that it was around Christmas.  This was 
a huge embarrassment to me because I certainly knew when my birthday was and 
I didn't like pretending that I didn't.  So I went to first grade.  My 
teacher was a very old woman whom I did not like.  I learned something about 
reading, but not much.  I was there for only a short time and then I was 
kicked out and my mother sent me to Miss Mirsky's school in our neighborhood 
to which I rode my newly acquired bike.  I hated this school, it was entirely 
too juvenile for me.  All I can remember of it except for the trip on my bike 
which I enjoyed very much, was coloring grapes on a preprinted sheet of 
paper. I thought this was eminently stupid and I don't think I stayed too 
long at that school.  But the next year I entered first grade legally and I 
had a wonderful Jewish teacher, the only one in the school, who loved me and 
patted me on the head just out of affection.  From her I learned to read in 
five minutes.  But the old teacher was still around and we went to her for 
music and every time I saw her I tried to hide so she wouldn't see me.  That 
was the second trauma of my life, the first being Aunt Sally's remark.
