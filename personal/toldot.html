<h2>Parshat Toldot </h2>
 
<p>
It says that  Rivka's  first child came out admoni (ruddy) 
and kaderet sehar (hairy) and that he was called Esav (verse 25:25). 
It is interesting to recall that he is destined to inherit mount Sehir and Edom. 
Similar names .
 But it seems like the verse is trying to explain why he is called Esav.  I.e because he is ruddy and hairy he was called Esav.  But what is the linguistic connection between Esav and Sehir (or certainly to Edom!?)?
Perhaps Esav real name is Eser or Asher (replacing the final vav with a resh, a similar looking letter, sort of)  Eser is the same letters as Sehir just moved around. Thus we have a name explanation. In that case, Esav represents the god Ashera, a tree god. Asher in Hebrew means a variety of good things, happy, rich, and ten which shows its connection to a god that brings wealth and happiness. Then what is Jacob?
<p>



It says that Esav is a man of the field (verse 25:27) whereas Jacob is a man of the tent. In the next verse it is written that Isaac loved Esav and Rivka loved Jacob seemingly because of these characteristics.
Why? In chapter 24:63 Isaac is described as "speaking in the field". And in verse 67 he brings Rivka into Sara's tent.  Thus we see that Isaac is outdoors person and Rivka stays in the tent.  So Isaac loves Esav whom he sees a continuer of his path.  Rivka loves Jacob since he follows her path.
 </p>
<p>
Perhaps Jacob represents the god of the tent and Esav represents the god of the outdoors (trees and fields). This may also be reflected in Jacobs name. Jacobs name means "heel" or "stuck" and a tent digs its heels into the ground and is stuck. A tent has tent pegs and man must stick the tent into the ground.
 <p>
Thus there are two primitive centers of worship, the indoors and the outdoors.  Perhaps inner contemplation versus wonder and awe of the created world.  These two spiritual avenues can complement one another or conflict with one another.  We have Isaac and Esav on the one hand and Jacob and Rivka on the other. 
 <p>
We know that the Ashera and Baal were the perennial antagonists to the Israelite religion, yet they were worshiped widely by the Israelites.  So the Bible cannot completely remove all reference to them since that would conflict with the people's deep feelings and leave them without their folklore.  So, instead, the Bible reworks these traditions and casts Ashera in the role of evil twin brother while at the same time corrupting its name.  That only the god of the tent is legitimate, we are taught in the various stories of the birthright and blessing passing to Jacob. And as we know, the Tabernacle or tent is the venue of the Israelite G-d.  (Baal is not in these stories at all.)

ashera is with alef
also asher - happines 

osher with ayin - welth

i heard esav comes from "asuy" (made, ready) because he had hair like an adult. 
he is an asiya, action, person. 
yaakov becomes more active after he gets the bracha and leaves the tents.

tent pegs:
