Rambam tells us (1) of three approaches to understanding the Midrashim
of the Rabbis.  The first approach is to take them as literally true,
believing them fully even in spite of any incongruence or
impossibilities.  The second approach, too, takes them literally, but
rejects them when they contradict reason or science.  The first approach
is common among the religiously faithful community, while the second
typifies the non-believing public.  But Rambam favors a third approach.
Realizing that the Rabbis were very wise, he says one should not take
their words literally; but instead one should interpret any incongruence
or scientific impossibilities found in their word as metaphors for
deeper, more abstract concepts.
<P>
 A classic example of this may be found in the description of the
manna.  The Sages describe the manna as a miraculous food. (2) It had
any taste its consumer wished.  It came from heaven to each man's door,
or further away if he sinned.  It was exactly the right amount for each
person, and it left no residue in the body such that there was no need
to expel waste. Observant Jews take this in its literal sense.
Alternatively, there have been various attempts by modern scientists to
try to identify a plant in the desert fitting these descriptions.  This
endeavor may be of some interest, but we must ask ourselves, how would
Rambam want us to read these explanations? Surely, we are meant to find
a deeper meaning.
<P>
The latter half of parshat beha'aholtekha provides some clues to this
deeper meaning of the manna.
<P>
In verse 11:4 the marginal element among the Jews "lusted a lust" and
began to complain.  Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk in his classic text,
Meshech Chochmah (3) asks what does it mean to "lust a lust"? Before we
answer this let us look at verse 11:5.  Here the Israelites go on to
complain that they remember the free fish they enjoyed in Egypt.  Yet as
Rashi points out, nothing in Egypt was free.  So what did the Jews mean?
Rashi states that they really meant they wanted to be free from
mitzvot.  Rabbi Meir Simcha explains that since fish needs no special
laws to eat it, such as shechitah, it was unencumbered, "free" food.  So
their lust for meat was a desire to eat meat like they used to eat
fish - easily, with no mitzvah or spiritual element.   In their complaint
against the manna, the Israelites say, (verse 11:6) "ein kol", there is
nothing there.  Meaning, this food doesn't go through the ordinary
digestive process - it has no residue. (4) And this is precisely what they
disliked; they wanted to eat normally.  The Torah then in verse 11:7-8
explains how great manna was, tasting like "leshad hashemen," a fried
sweet dough (Rashi).
<P>
But this physical description is countered by the Talmud's metaphysical
description of the taste of the manna.  The Talmud points out that for
evil people the manna was troublesome. The taste is dependent on ones
spiritual level.  How could this be? Rabbi Meir Simcha explains that
although we may try to describe the manna, we cannot succeed.  It is
similar to Rambam's explanation regarding the impossibility of
understanding heaven, which is non-physical, as long as we live steeped
in a physical world; this being like trying to explain colors to a
person blind from birth.   The manna having a taste dependent on your
spiritual level is a metaphor meaning that eating the manna was a
spiritual experience of pleasure, not a normal taste.  It is as though
the soul's taste buds tasted it.  But it was not a physical food as we
understand food.  In the same way that with a number of people listening
to the same music, some may like it and others won't.  The music is the
same; one just has to develop sensitivity to it.  By complaining that
they didn't like the taste of the manna, the Israelites were in fact
complaining that they were not spiritually ready for it and wanted to be
left at a lower spiritual plane.
<P>
Just as learning Torah is pleasurable only if you are ready for it, so
too the manna needed spiritual readiness to be enjoyed.  And in fact,
those who appreciated Torah appreciated manna.  Let us elaborate on this
comparison.  In whose merit did the Israelites receive the manna? Aaron
brought protective clouds, Miriam brought water, and Moshe brought the
manna.  He also brought the Torah.  Eating and loving manna shows ones
love of Moshe's teaching.  Rejecting manna is a rejection of his
teaching.  Rabbi Meir Simcha goes on to explain that normally eating
meat develops all types of physical desires, but eating manna, causes
the reverse, as one eats it, ones physical desires dissipate.   By
eating the manna, the Israelites had lost their physical, sensual,
desires.  It follows then that the Israelites should have lost their
desire for meat.  Why then did they ask for meat? We must realize that
the Israelites did not like this state of affairs.  They wanted to
redevelop their physical desires.  Thus it says they lusted the lust.
They wanted to attain once again the lust for physical pleasures.  They
lusted to have the lust again.  They had lost their enjoyment for life
and they were not on a high enough spiritual level to find life's
pleasure in Torah.   Their request for meat symbolizes their desire to
reenter the world of sensual pleasures.
<P>
Now we can understand Moshe's harsh reaction starting at verse 11, where
he says: "Did I give birth to these people so that I have to support
them physically? Where should I get enough meat?" We might ask, what
kind of a question is this? Of course G-d can provide Moshe with meat.
But we must realize that Moshe is expressing the difference between
being rabbenu (teacher) and not being avinu (father).  Avinu is an
eternal relationship - your child is always yours.  But this is not so
with a teacher.  Moshe is the nation's teacher, and the moment the gap is
too great, the people can no longer be his disciples, and Moshe ceases
to be their leader.  Rejecting the manna and opting for a more physical
existence is rejecting Moshe.
<P>
 This explains G-d's reply to Moshe's complaint.  G-d tells Moshe he
must choose a Sanhedrin of 70 elders (verses 11:16-18).  On first sight
this makes no sense.  Will the elders be in charge of acquiring,
collecting and distributing meat? It doesn't seem so.  Once we realize
that the real issue is not manna, but Moshe as leader we can understand
it.  The gap between Moshe's high level and the nation's low level is
filled by the Sanhedrin.  By Moshe saying, I cannot give them meat, he
means I am not a physical leader, I cannot provide physical food.  I can
only be a spiritual leader.
<P>
Now, when the Sanhedrin was chosen, they received a prophetic
experience - just like Moshe.  But two people, who despite their
prophetic state, would not join the Sanhedrin.  They were Eldad and
Medad.  But they did reveal their prophecy to Joshua.  Moshe will die
and Joshua will bring people into land.  Moshe is not bothered by this
prophecy, but Joshua is.  What is the meaning of the timing of this
prophecy here? Moshe can no longer be their leader.  His inability to
take them into Eretz Yisrael is further proof of that.  The gap between
leader and nation is too wide.  The gap was caused by many failings of
the people, such as their complaint, after leaving the sea of reeds,
that they want water; their sigh of relief after revelation at Mount
Sinai; their worshiping the golden calf; and finally their request for
meat.  At the moment of Matan Torah there was the closeness of teacher
and student, and, had it lasted, Moshe would have been able to lead the
people into the land.  Thus, even the prophecy relates to the issue of
Moshe as leader, and the inability of the nation to be at the level of
the manna which represents a spiritual existence.
<P>
Chapter 12 may at first seem unrelated to the preceding chapter.
Miriam and Aaron criticize Moshe for not having normal marital relations
with his wife.  All the other prophets need not separate from their
wives, but Moshe does.  Normal prophets are attached to their bodies;
their bodies are not prophetic bodies, so they can have relations.  But
Moshe was in a constant state of prophecy and marital relations would
disturb that state.  Miriam's critique was not simply aimed at Moshe's
behavior with his wife.  She was telling him that while it is true that
there must be a gap between teacher and disciple, or else there can be
no real education, the gap cannot be too wide.
<P>
There are two ways to close a gap - either to raise up the nation, or to
lower Moshe.  Miriam's advice was essentially that Moshe should talk
down on the level of the nation.  She wanted Moshe to remain leader even
if it meant he would have to come down from his level.  This is the
meaning of Miriam's advice that Moshe be with his wife; he should become
a physical leader.  The only problem with this is that G-d says that
Moshe was in such a high state that it was impossible for him to lower
himself.  Either the nation must elevate itself or an intermediary must
be found: the Sanhedrin.
<P>
Thus we see a common thread unifying the parshah: the rejection of the
manna, the establishment of the Sanhedrin, and the prophecy that Moshe
won't bring the Jewish people into the Land, all point to the people's
inability to be the disciples of Moshe.  The manna is the symbol of
Moshe's Torah teachings and a metaphor for the spiritual life.  In this
light we can understand the seemingly bizarre statements in Midrash
Rabba.  When it says that the manna has any taste its consumer wishes,
it may mean that Torah needs to be adjusted to the needs of the student,
and that each student will discover something uniquely his own in the
Torah.  That the manna comes from heaven to each man's door, or further
away if he sins indicates that the Torah, like the manna, is a Divine
gift, which is difficult to obtain without spiritual purity and
readiness and Divine help.  Using Rambam's principle of searching out the
hidden meaning of obscure rabbinic statements, we have hopefully
uncovered gems of wisdom hidden in the Torah.

<h1> Short Ideas of mine</h1>
It is hard to understand why the people asked for meat at this time.  
We know they had cattle.  Surely they could eat it.  Also, why 
does Moses doubt that G-d can provide a large amount of meat? He surely
knows that G-d can do really just about anything.
Leviticus Ch 17 verse 3-4 
is generally understood (Ramban) to mean that meating eating in the 
desert was only allowed if the animal was brought as a sacrifice in the 
Mishkan (according to Rabbi Yishmael in the B.Talmud (Zvachim 107a)).
See also B.Talmud Chulin 17b says that "chulin" meat was prohibited in 
the desert because all of the Israelites were relatively close to the 
Mishkan as the encampment was but three "parsoh" square, approximately 9 
miles square according to some opinions. 
In Eretz Yisroel, G-d does not burden them to 
travel great distances to the Bet Hamikdash to have their animals 
slaughtered as sacrifices. He therefore allowed them to slaughter 
non-sacrificial animals. 

<p> This sedra starts just after the finishing of the inaugural 
sacrifices for the Mishkan.  That means that the altar is ready and 
from now on all animals that are slaughtered must be brought
as sacrifices.  For some reason - either a resistance to the
spiritual purity required for the bringing of sacrifices, or 
the non-allowance of todot and shlamim (only olot were permitted), or
the need to wait in turn until the altar was available
 - the people felt they no longer could eat meat as that had before.
<p> When G-d promised to bring them meat for 30 days, Moses said, "Can sheep 
and cattle be slaughtered for them and it be enough?"  Moses imagined
that G-d intended to bring livestock to be slaughtered on the altar.  Clearly
it is impossible to slaugther enough meat for 600,000 men for 30 day
on one altar. Moses realizes that bringing fish would
be an alternative since they cannot be brought as sacrifices and therefore 
would not need the altar.
But since they are "gathered" and not slaughtered at all  they may not
satisfy the people's need to slaughter animals (Alternatively,
Moses may have honestly thought there are not enough fish in the sea 
to feed the people.  Perhaps he was not well aware of the size of the sea.)
In any case, G-d brought quails.  What is interesting is that quail is a
kosher bird which is slaughtered and yet it is not allowed to be brought as 
a sacrifice.
  Therefore, it represents the idea that animals can be slaughtered even if
they are not being used as a sacrifice. Thus G-d satisfied the people's need 
for  slaughtered meat without forcing them to bring sacrifices.  Perhaps this
Divine act signified the the new allowance of non-sacrificial slaughtering 
(chulin) in the desert.

Verse 10 in Chapter -- States "Behold Miriam was metzorat, as white as snow. And Aharon look and behold,
she was metzorat."  The word behold implies a sudden new revelation.  What was new in the second
beholding of Aharon? She already was metzorat.  Why do we even need to be told that Aharon looked at her, 
surely many people saw her, why mention that Aharon also looked at her?  And why only in the first beholding does 
the Torah say she was as white as snow?  
<p>Miriam was punished for speaking badly about Moses.  Aharon also participated in this bad speach, but we do not
see that he received any punishment.  True he was not the instigator, but he should receive some form of
punishment.  
<p>The Answer: We know that when a house gets signs of tzarat in the walls, the High Priest must be brought
to the house to declare it impure.  The house is not retroactively impure but is only impure from the moment 
the Priest says it is.  Therefore, the Torah advises the owner to remove all items from the house
before inviting the Priest to inspect the house. In this way these items will not become impure.
So we see that in the case of tzarat it is not enough to show the signs of tzarat to be considered impure
but one also needs the pronouncement of the Priest.  Aharon was the High Priest in the wilderness.
The verse is telling us that Miriam was merely white as like <em>like</em> a tzarat person but was not yet 
a metzora.  When Aharon looked 
at her, he suddenly blurted out that she was metzorat.  That is the meaning of the second Behold.  He acted
suddenly without his own volition.  Aharon could have delayed declaring her a metzora to give her time to 
prepare or perhaps never declare her metzora.  But G-d punished him that his freedom of
action was removed and he found himself declaring her metzorah without having made the decision to do so.  This was 
Aharon's punishment, and this explains the suddenness of the second behold and why Miriam is described as
white as snow in the first instance.
