<pre>end of sefer shoftim - no king 
<p>then shmuel  - his power is to annoint kings , eg. shaul, david
Netzach Israel lo ...
shmuel the shepard- strength of Israel , but before, there was no king.
Pilegesh beGiva- happened in  beginning of shoftim (acc to pshat)
but according to tradition last part of shoftim - i t is what preceded
and there was no king - our situation is same - without or before a king rules.
we are at end of shoftim.
the ari revealed peoples root souls of previous generation
- a tanna is gilgul of biblical figure
concubine of giva was mended by Aha Bar Yaakov - the husband of the concubine was
fixed by him.
<p>where is this hinted? Esau said yesh li rav ahi- hints at rav aha -he is the rav of
ahi (my brother esau)
Rav aha is that Esau is Israel's brother
ari- Esau "tzad ztayid befiv shel esau" - Isaac would find good in esau
so too, R. Aha bar yaakov finds sparks 
son was yaakov ben r. aha bar yaakov - sent him to study hall
abaye heard father was coming also, and abaye
knew there was a mazik in the study hall - and it would
even hurt two people, even the students of abaye suffered.
so if R aha is coming maybe he can solve this problem.  so he commanded
the citizens not to let him sleep with them - so he'd have to sleep in 
the study hall.  the mazid took the apearance of a snake and bowed 7 times in 
prayer.  and so the mazik died.  In the mornign complained to abaye
that you endangered me.  Ari says this fixed concubine story and prepares
for birth of shmuel and kingship.
Abaye is the old man who lived in giva who took in the husband - no one
else allowed him in.
<p>the concubine is the tanin, the mazik, killed by 7 bows.
the townsfolk who raped her are the students of abaye.
teh concubine came back to damage them in return for raping her.
Now r. aha before is alos in the story of esau "yesh li rav achi"
r. aha is secret of 7 bowing of jacob which he did to sweeten his brother
and as a result he kissed him.
bow 7 times to refine his sparks, destroy him.
so r aha bowed 7 times.
what are teh 7 heads - they are the 7 kings of esau which were before a
 king ruled in Israel
Head symbolizes ideology - there is a snake in learning torah, in 
the study house.  the study house contains 7 ideologies of learning torah.
there are 7 false hashkafot which must be destroyed via prayer or bitul.
Even sword on neck, still pray because G-d can save,
bow - is bitul, my opinions are batel to G-d's opinions and therefore 
the bows destroyed the snake. 
<p>Shlomo married Pharoah's daughter- brought into his home false ideas.
we pray to G-d , focus on G-d to get true hashkafa
to do this we must be baal daat or gadlut mochin.
Yosef was son of old age, targum: son of wisdom, he was able to Noseh hafuchim
- or erech apayim - therefore he is loved 
Today is 3rd day of vayetze (tuesday)
Eben Yisrael - big sin of tribes was sellinf yosef = not wanting gadlut mochim
- to try to do a birur mitoch katnut mochim.
they knew Yosef wanted to bring broad mindedness - to be "himloch timloch"
so they sold him to avoid this wisdom.
<p>central point is daat - ch. 3 power of daat in soul
bowing comes from oref - neck- bowing the daat -intellect- ->action - 
neck is in between  [head and body, thought and action]
we are a nation which can't easilly come to action.
kashe oref because we have wisdom. we do havdalah at end of shabbat
but the true havdala there is between Jew and Gentile
main use of daat is to distinguish  - lehavdil
18 blessings for life (18)
spine is straight but in prayer it is bent
why is daat in back - in spine? because daat is a intuition
not done via a pure sense, it just comes to you 
i believe i can fix but my senses tell me i can't fix
but my daat leads me to believe i can change, that requires daat.
<p>the masses then fought the people of giva
now masses want the wye accord but they are wrong
daat needs to be spread to the masses, faith is leave from despair
ratzon wish for good - but it only lasts if you have daat
how does Tanya define daat? Adam knew eve, connected daat to G-d and to never 
leave off thinking of G-d
kli and Ohr - internal and external
koach ha Yahud - join rahamim and din to know h' hoo elokim is to have 
koach yihud
<p>a captive can't free self from prison.  we must free the populice from 
false faith in wye accord, like maccasbees freed people from from hellinism
Jail is a cellar, clothed in darkness.  daat to nullify self
forbidden to rahem al mi sh'ein lo daat
how can moshiach come in hesek hadaat?
ki ashiv behoshech = 6 x yosef
yosef adds children - brings Jews back to torah to be banim
sham roeh even israel, ben kach u'ben kach
spread torah until foot stops in shuk, tillthe is no person 28
daat is power of yichud.  Jew can always think ipcha mistabra
only a Jew can say reality says yes, i say no! only a Jew can do this
but we have to unite opinions
<p>ratzon = keter
ratzon is makif , i.e. we don;t always think of it  but
without daat the belief that the moshiach will come is nothing
you have to not masiach daat
mashechet shabat - r zera - asks "why do goats go before sheep" to r.
yehuda - goats are black - sheep are white (rashi)
answer " just like creation, must first be darkness then light"
daat is hitaztmut with ratzon
jews are Azim b'umot- goat is also aiz- strong
hassid must be strong metzach (also must be like yosef, gadol mochim)
why azim go first? why is strength before softness?
be aiz like a leapard - beginning of shulchan aruch

Rov shira b'zimrah - last words of Rebbe simcha turns dark to light.
