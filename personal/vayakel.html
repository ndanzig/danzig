<h2>Vayakel</h2>

<p>
This parsha 
starts with a discussion about keeping shabbat
and not  burning fire on shabbat.
Why is this discussion in the middle of the description of the mishkan  (tabernacle)?
Rashi says this teaches not to do work of mishkan on shabbat. And therefore we learn that all
39 forms of work which were done in the mishkan are forbidden on the shabbat.


<p>
But in Parshat Kitisa, the
pervious parsha, in  chapter 31 verse 13 it is written "<i>Ach et shabbtotai 
tishmoru</i>"  ("But you must keep my Sabbaths") - Rashi says teaches that 
the work on mishkan must
be stopped on shabbat, and therefore  teaches 39 malachot.

<p>

Why two sources for the same thing?
  Talmud in Shabbat 71 actually learns from this parsha, not kitisa.
Why?

Ki tisa is God telling Moshe. 
Vayakel is Moshe telling the people.

Should not we learn from  the place where the Law is originally 
taught by God?
But no, The Torah is man's Torah, so we learn the oral law 
from the place where Moshe our teacher tells us.  This puts man squarely
in the center of the law.

Interesting things in prev parsha

End of ki tisa 34:34  mask of moshe . 

2. ohel moed versus mishkan, moshe's tent is also called ohel moed, but so is inner part of mishkan.
