 <h2> We Would Be Slaves To Pharaoh in Egypt</h2>

0. The simple meaning that that empire would never have ended it hard to imagine.  Empires come and go.  So had G-d not taken us out, we would be free in some other way.  The tower of Babel teaches us that every empire will eventually
come to internal fracture and crumble away, even if no outside force destroys it.
This was impalnted into the nature of empires by G-d at that juncture.  So egypt would surley have ended at some time.

1. On the simplest level this statement should be understood as a statement of
out mental attitude.  We should try to imagine that we might still be slave 
in Egypt.  And then imagine that our children and grandchildren would be there too.  And from thinking of how terrible this all is and then realizing that G-d
brought us out , we are teh more grateful to Him and will praise him with real feeling and conviction.  So this is a mental exercise using the imagination.  It is an injunction on us to go through these steps in our imagination so we can prasie G-d truly.

2.  On another level it should be understood as a statement of a certain 
transformation which occured in the Jewish people that made us perminently free people. Being "meshubad" means to be subserviant to another people.  
Most ancient people have died out over the years.  Where are teh visigoths?  The Huns?  The Medes?  They were either wiped out or obsorbed into another people.  The Jews have suffered teh same circumstances as these people, yet we have not died out.
We have suffer persecution and subjegation.  We have fgace assimilation, but where other nations have disolved in these cases, we have survived.  In part this is becasue we have identity re-inforcing holidays like Passover to remind us of who we are.
But also there is a miraculous character to our survival.  G-d has caused this.  By taking us out of Egypt he made us a free people.  So we can never truly by subjugated.  No matter what we suffer we will remain inwardly free.  Anything that G-d does is permanent, so our freedom is permanent.
This is the meaning of teh statemnet that Had g-d not taken us out of Egypt we would still be slaves in Egypt.
The meaning is that we would have eventually fallen prey to shiabud and eitehr me wiped out or assimilated into another nation.  nbe env tte, but pThs have fell oehr a0lenI/  etany
