<h2>Fruits of the Ginosar</h2>
<h3>Talmud Brochot 44a</h3>
<p>
The Babylonian Talmud discusses the fruits of Ginosar
in Mesechta Brochot 44a.
<p>
The story is as follows: The rav  ate
the fruits until the flies slipped from his forhead from the
sweat.
Superficially, this can be seen as a way of showing how flavorful 
the fruits were that even a great rav could not restrain himself
from over indulging in them.
<br>
But Maimonides teaches us that many strange stories in 
the Talmud should be understood metaphorically (as a <i>mashal</i>).
This story can be understood as a <i>mashal</i> in the following way.

<p>  The Fly is a
symbol of the yetzer HaRa (gemara) and the sweat
refers to the sin of Adam  which resulted in our
working by our sweat.  Sin in general comes from our
involvment if the physical. But this rav was on such a
high level that his physical inclinations (<i>gashmiut</i>)
 were not affected by  "the fly".  
<p>
The fruit of the ginosar are like the
fruits of Gan Eden (gemara) and so the zadikim will
enjoy them.  I.e  they will exist in this world
unaffected by the yetzer hara. The punishment of Adam
was that he would eat bread by his sweat, i.e. his
gashmiut will come to him in a way which will taint him with the yetzer
hara.  But this rav got his bread without that sin.
<p>
Thus the Gemara here says that these fruit are not
<i>batel</i> to bread, but bread it <i>batel</i> to them.  They
represent this higher, sinless involvment with the
physical, different from Adam's involvment with the physical.
He produced bread by the sweat of his brow. Thus his bread
represents the sinfull existence.

<br>
Also Yaakov avinu is compared to Adam before
the sin (gemara).
