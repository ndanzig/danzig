THE term 'ezeb is homonymous, denoting, in the first place, pain
and trembling; comp." In sorrow (be-'ezeb) thou shalt bring forth
children" (Gen. iii. 16). Next it denotes anger; comp." And his
father had not made him angry ('azabo) at any time" (I Kings i.
6):" for he was angry (ne'ezab) for the sake of David" (I Sam. xx.
34). The term signifies also provocation: comp." They rebelled,
and vexed ('izzebu) his holy spirit" (Isa. lxiii. 10):" and provoked
(ya'azibahu) him in the desert" (Ps. lxxviii. 4o);" If there be any
way of provocation ('ozeb) in me" (ib. cxxxix. 24) Every day they
rebel (ye'azzebu) against my words" (ib. Ivi. 6).
In Genesis vi. 6 the word has either the second or the third
signification. In the first case, the sense of the Hebrew va-yit'azzeb
el libbo is God was angry with them on account of the wickedness
of their deeds" as to the words" to his heart" used here, and also
in the history of Noah (ib. viii. 21) 1 will here explain what they
mean. With regard to man, we use the expression" he said to
himself," or" he said in his heart," in reference to a subject which
he did not utter or communicate to any other person. Similarly the
phrase" And God said in his heart," is used in reference to an act
which God decreed without mentioning it to any prophet at the
time the event took place according to the will of God. And a
figure of this kind is admissible, since" the Torah speaketh in
accordance with the language of man" (supra c. xxvi.). This is
plain and dear. In the Pentateuch no distinct mention is made of a
message sent to the wicked generation of the flood, cautioning or
threatening them with death; therefore, it is said concerning them,
that God was angry with them in His heart; likewise when He
decreed that no flood should happen again, He did not tell a
prophet to communicate it to others, and for that reason the words"
in his heart" are added.
Taking the verb in the third signification, we explain the passage
thus:" And man rebelled against God's will concerning him" : for
leb (heart) also signifies" will," as we shall explain when treating
of the homonymity of leb (heart).
