THE homonymous term adam is in the first place the name of the
first man, being, as Scripture indicates, derived from adamah,"
earth." Next, it means" mankind," as" My spirit shall not strive
with man (adam)" (Gen. vi. 3). Again" Who knoweth the spirit of
the children of man (adam)" (Eccles. iii. 21):" so that a man (
adam) has no pre-eminence above a beast" (Eccles. iii. 19). Adam.
signifies also" the multitude ... .. the lower classes" as opposed to
those distinguished from the rest, as" Both low (bene adam) and
high (bene ish)" (Ps. xlix. 3).
It is in this third signification that it occurs in the verses," The
sons of the higher order (Elohim) saw the daughters of the lower
order (adam)" (Gen. vi. 2): and" Forsooth! as the humble man
(adam) you shall die" (Ps. lxxxii. 7).
