THE philosophers have uttered very perverse ideas as regards
God's Omniscience of everything beside Himself: they have
stumbled in such a manner that they cannot rise again, nor can
those who adopt their views. 1 will further on tell you the doubts
that led them to these perverse utterances on this question; and I
will also tell you the opinion which is taught by our religion, and
which differs from the evil and wrong principles of the
philosophers as regards God's Omniscience.
The principal reason that first induced the philosophers to adopt
their theory is this: at first thought we notice an absence of system
in human affairs. Some pious men live a miserable and painful
life, whilst some wicked people enjoy a happy and pleasant life.
On this account the philosophers assumed as possible the cases
which you will now hear. They said that only one of two things is
possible, either God is ignorant of the individual or particular
things on earth, and does not perceive them, or He perceives and
knows them. These are all the cases possible. They then continued
thus: If He perceives and knows all individual things, one of the
following three cases must take place: (1) God arranges and
manages human affairs well, perfectly and faultlessly; (2) He is
overcome by obstacles, and is too weak and powerless to manage
human affairs; (3) He knows [all things] and can arrange and
manage them, but leaves and abandons them, as too base, low, and
vile, or from jealousy; as we may also notice among ourselves
some who are able to make another person happy, well knowing
what he wants for his happiness, and still in consequence of their
evil disposition, their wickedness and jealousy against him, they
do not help him to his happiness.-- This is likewise a complete
enumeration of all possible cases. For those who have a knowledge
of a certain thing necessarily either (1) take care of the thing which
they know, and manage it, or (2) neglect it (as we, e.g., neglect and
forget the cats in our house, or things of less importance); or (3)
while taking care of it, have not sufficient power and strength for
its management, although they have the will to do so. Having
enumerated these different cases, the philosophers emphatically
decided that of the three cases possible [as regards the
management of a thing] by one who knows that thing], two are
inadmissible in reference to God viz., want of power, or absence of
will: because they imply either evil disposition or weakness,
neither of which can by any means be attributed to Him.
Consequently there remains only the alternative that God is
altogether ignorant of human affairs, or that He knows them and
manages them well. Since we, however, notice that events do not
follow a certain order, that they cannot be determined by analogy,
and are not in accordance with what is wanted, we conclude that
God has no knowledge of them in any way or for any reason. This
is the argument which led the philosophers to speak such
blasphemous words. In the treatise On Providence, by Alexander
Aphrodisiensis, you will find the same as I have said about the
different views of the philosophers, and as I have stated as to the
source of their error.
You must notice with surprise that the evil into which these
philosophers have fallen is greater than that from which they
sought to escape, and that they ignore the very thing which they
constantly pointed out and explained to us. They have fallen into a
greater evil than that from which they sought to escape, because
they refuse to say that God neglects or forgets a thing, and yet they
maintain that His knowledge is imperfect, that He is ignorant of
what is going on here on earth, that He does not perceive it. They
also ignore, what they constantly point out to us, in as much as
they judge the whole universe by that which befalls individual
men, although, according to their own view, frequently stated and
explained, the evils of man originate in himself, or form part of his
material nature. We have already discussed this sufficiently. After
having laid this foundation, which is the ruin of all good
principles, and destroys the majesty of all true knowledge, they
sought to remove the opprobrium by declaring that for many
reasons it is impossible that God should have a knowledge of
earthly things, for the individual members of a species can only be
perceived by the senses, and not by reason: but God does not
perceive by means of any of the senses. Again, the individuals are
infinite, but knowledge comprehends and circumscribes the object
of its action, and the infinite cannot be comprehended or
circumscribed: furthermore, knowledge of individual beings, that
are subject to change, necessitates some change in him who
possesses it, because this knowledge itself changes constantly.
They have also raised the following two objections against those
who hold, in accordance with the teaching of Scripture, that God
knows things before they come into existence. First, this theory
implies that there can be knowledge of a thing that does not exist
at all: secondly, it leads to the conclusion that the knowledge of an
object in potentia is identical with the knowledge of that same
object in reality. They have indeed come to very evil conclusions,
and some of them assumed that God only knows the species, not
the individual beings, whilst others went as far as to contend that
God knows nothing beside Himself, because they believe that God
cannot have more than one knowledge.
Some of the great philosophers who lived before Aristotle agree
with us, that God knows everything, and that nothing is hidden
from Him. Alexander also refers to them in the above-mentioned
treatise: he differs from them, and says that the principal objection
against this theory is based on the fact that we clearly see evils
befalling good men, and wicked men enjoying happiness.
In short, you see that if these philosophers would find human
affairs managed according to rules laid down by the common
people, they would not venture or presume to speak on this
subject. They are only led to this viously been decreed. The
Ashariyah were therefore compelled to assume that motion and
rest of living beings are predestined, and that it is not in the power
of man to do a certain thing or to leave it undone. The theory
further implies a denial of possibility in these things: they can only
be either necessary or impossible. The followers of this theory
accepted also the lastmentioned proposition, and say, that we call
certain things possible, as e.g., the facts that Zeid stands, and that
Amr is coming: but they are only possible for us, whilst in their
relation to God they cannot be called possible: they are either
necessary or impossible. It follows also from this theory, that
precepts are perfectly useless, since the people to whom any law is
given are unable to do anything: they can neither do what they are
commanded nor abstain from what they are forbidden. The
supporters of this theory hold that it was the will of God to send
prophets, to command, to forbid, to promise, and to threaten,
although we have no power [over our actions]. A duty would thus
be imposed upon us which is impossible for us to carry out, and it
is even possible that we may suffer punishment when obeying the
command and receive reward when disobeying it. According to
this theory, it must also be assumed that the actions of God have
no final cause. All these absurdities are admitted by the Ashariyah
for the purpose of saving this theory. When we see a person born
blind or leprous, who could not have merited a punishment for
previous sins, they say, It is the will of God; when a pious
worshipper is tortured and slain, it is likewise the will of God; and
no injustice can be asserted to Him for that, for according to their
opinion it is proper that God should afflict the innocent and do
good to the sinner. Their views on these matters are well known.
Fourth Theory.-- Man has free will; it is therefore intelligible that
the Law contains commands and prohibitions, with
announcements of reward and punishment. All acts of God are due
to wisdom; no injustice is found in Him, and He does not afflict
the good. The Mu'tazila profess this theory, although they do not
believe in man's absolute free will. They hold also that God takes
notice of the falling of the leaf and the destruction of the ant, and
that His Providence extends over all things. This theory likewise
implies contradictions and absurdities. The absurdities are these:
The fact that some persons are born with defects, although they
have not sinned previously, is ascribed to the wisdom of God, it
being better for those persons to be in such a condition than to be
in a normal state, though we do not see why it is better; and they
do not suffer thereby any punishment at all, but, on the contrary,
enjoy God's goodness. In a similar manner the slaughter of the
pious is explained as being for them the source of an increase of
reward in future life. They go even further in their absurdities. We
ask them why is God only just to man and not to other beings, and
how has the irrational animal sinned, that it is condemned to be
slaughtered ? and they reply it is good for the animal, for it will
receive reward for it in the world to come; also the flea and the
louse will there receive compensation for their untimely death: the
same reasoning they apply to the mouse torn by a cat or vulture;
the wisdom of God decreed this for the mouse, in order to reward
it after death for the mishap. I do not consider it proper to blame
the followers of any of the Past named] three theories on
Providence, for they have been driven to accept them by weighty
considerations. Aristotle was guided by that which appears to be
the nature of things. The Ashariyah refused to ascribe to God
ignorance about anything, and to say that God whilst knowing one
individual being or one portion of the Universe is ignorant of
another portion; they preferred to admit the above-mentioned
absurdities. The Mu'tazilites refused to assume that God does what
is wrong and unjust; on the other hand, they would not contradict
common sense and say that it was not wrong to inflict pain on the
guiltless, or that the mission of the Prophets and the giving of the
Law had no intelligible reason. They likewise preferred to admit
the above-named absurdities. But they even contradicted
themselves, because they believe on the one hand that God knows
everything, and on the other that man has free win. By a little
consideration we discover the contradiction.
Fifth Theory.-- This is our theory, or that of our Law. I will show
you [first] the view expressed on this subject in our prophetical
books, and generally accepted by our Sages. I will then give the
opinion of some later authors among us, and lastly, I will explain
my own belief. The theory of man's perfectly free will is one of the
fundamental principles of the Law of our Teacher Moses, and of
those who follow the Law. According to this principle man does
what is in his power to do, by his nature, his choice, and his will;
and his action is not due to any faculty created for the purpose. All
species of irrational animals likewise move by their own free will.
This is the Will of God; that is to say, it is due to the eternal divine
will that all living beings should move freely, and that man should
have power to act according to his will or choice within the limits
of his capacity. Against this principle we hear, thank God, no
opposition on the part of our nation. Another fundamental
principle taught by the Law of Moses is this: Wrong cannot be
ascribed to God in any way whatever; all evils and afflictions as
well as all kinds of happiness of man, whether they concern one
individual person or a community, are distributed according to
justice; they are the result of strict judgment that admits no wrong
whatever. Even when a person suffers pain in consequence of a
thorn having entered into his hand, although it is at once drawn
out, it is a punishment that has been inflicted on him [for sin], and
the least pleasure he enjoys is a reward [for some good action]: all
this is meted out by strict justice; as is said in Scripture," all his
ways are judgment" (Deut. xxxii. 4): we are only ignorant of the
working of that judgment.
The different theories are now fully explained to you; everything
in the varying human affairs is due to chance, according to
Aristotle, to the Divine Will alone according to the Ashariyah, to
Divine Wisdom according to the Mu'tazilites, to the merits of man
according to our opinion. It is therefore possible, according to the
Asbariyah, that God inflicts pain on a good and pious man in this
world, and keeps him for ever in fire, which is assumed to rage in
the world to come , they simply say it is the Will of God. The
Mu'tazilites would consider this as injustice, and therefore assume
that every being, even an ant, that is stricken with pain [in this
world], has compensation for it, as has been mentioned above; and
it is due to God's Wisdom that a being is struck and afflicted in
order to receive compensation. We, however, believe that all these
human affairs are managed with justice; far be it from God to do
wrong, to punish any one unless the punishment is necessary and
merited. It is distinctly stated in the Law, that all is done in
accordance with justice; and the words of our Sages generally
express the same idea. They clearly say:" There is no death without
sin, no sufferings without transgression." (B. T. Shabbath, 55a.)
Again," The deserts of an are meted out to him in the same
measure which he himself employs." (Mish. Sotah, i. 7.) These are
the words of the Mishnah. Our Sages declare it wherever
opportunity is given, that the idea of God necessarily implies
justice; that He will reward the most pious for all their pure and
upright actions, although no direct commandment was given them
through a prophet; and that He will punish all the evil deeds of
men, although they have not been prohibited by a prophet, if
common sense warns against them, as e.g., injustice and violence.
Thus our Sages say:" God does not deprive any being of the full
reward [of its good deed]" (B. T. Pes. 118a) again," He who says
that God remits part of a punishment;, will be punished severely;
He is long-suffering, but is sure to exact payment." (B. T. Baba K.
5oa.) Another saying is this:" He who has received a
commandment and acts accordingly is not like him who acts in the
same manner without being commanded to do so" (B. T. Kidd.
31a); and it is distinctly added that he who does a good thing
without being commanded, receives nevertheless his reward. The
same principle is expressed in all sayings of our Sages. But they
contain an additional doctrine which is not found in the Law; viz.,
the doctrine of" afflictions of love," as taught by some of our
Sages. According to this doctrine it is possible that a person be
afflicted without having previously committed any sin, in order
that his future reward may be increased; a view which is held by
the Mu'tazilites, but is not supported by any Scriptural text. Be not
misled by the accounts of trials, such as" God tried Abraham"
(Gen. xxii. 1):" He afflicted thee and made thee hungry," etc.
(Deut. viii. 3); for you will hear more on this subject later on
(chap. xxiv.). Our Law is only concerned with the relations of
men; but the idea that irrational living beings should receive a
reward, has never before been heard of in our nation: the wise men
mentioned in the Talmud do not notice it; only some of the later
Geonim were pleased with it when they heard it from the sect of
the Mu'tazilites, and accepted it.
My opinion on this principle of Divine Providence I will now
explain to you. In the principle which I now proceed to expound I
do not rely on demonstrative proof, but on my conception of the
spirit of the Divine Law, and the writings of the Prophets. The
principle which I accept is far less open to objections, and is more
reasonable than the opinions mentioned before. It is this: In the
lower or sublunary portion of the Universe Divine Providence does
not extend to the individual members of species except in the case
of mankind. It is only in this species that the incidents in the
existence of the individual beings, their good and evil fortunes, are
the result of justice, in accordance with the words," For all His
ways are judgment." But I agree with Aristotle as regards all other
living beings, and a fortiori as regards plants and all the rest of
earthly creatures. For I do not believe that it is through the
interference of Divine Providence that a certain leaf drops [from a
tree], nor do I hold that when a certain spider catches a certain fly,
that this is the direct result of a special decree and will of God in
that moment; it is not by a particular Divine decree that the spittle
of a certain person moved, fell on a certain gnat in a certain place,
and killed it; nor is it by the direct will of God that a certain fish
catches and swallows a certain worm on the surface of the water.
In all these cases the action is, according to my opinion, entirely
due to chance, as taught by Aristotle. Divine Providence is
connected with Divine intellectual influence, and the same beings
which are benefited by the latter so as to become intellectual, and
to comprehend things comprehensible to rational beings, are also
under the control of Divine Providence, which examines all their
deeds in order to reward or punish them. It may be by mere chance
that a ship goes down with all her contents, as in the
above-mentioned instance, or the roof of a house falls upon those
within; but it is not due to chance, according to our view, that in
the one instance the men went into the ship, or remained in the
house in the other instance: it is due to the will of God, and is in
accordance with the justice of His judgments, the method of which
our mind is incapable of understanding. I have been induced to
accept this theory by the circumstance that I have not met in any of
the prophetical books with a description of God's Providence
otherwise than in relation to human beings. The prophets even
express their surprise that God should take notice of man, who is
too little and too unimportant to be worthy of the attention of the
Creator: how, then, should other living creatures be considered as
proper objects for Divine Providence! Comp." What is man, that
thou takest knowledge of him ?" (Ps. cxliv. 3):" What is man, that
thou art mindful of him ?" (ibid. viii. 8). It is dearly expressed in
many Scriptural passages that God provides for all men, and
controls all their deeds -- e.g.," He fashioneth their hearts alike, he
considereth all their works" (ibid. xxxiii. 15);" For thine eyes are
open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one
according to his ways" (Jer. xxxii. 19). Again:" For his eyes are
upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings" (job xxxii. 21).
In the Law there occur instances of the fact that men are governed
by God, and that their actions are examined by him. Comp. In the
day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them 11 (Exod. xxxii.
34)" I will even appoint over you terror" (Lev. xxvi. 16):"
Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book"
(Exod. xxxii. 33):" The same soul will I destroy" (Lev. xxiii. 30):"
I will even set my face against that soul" (ibid. xx. 6). There are
many instances of this kind. All that is mentioned of the history of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is a perfect proof that Divine
Providence extends. to every man individually. But the condition
of the individual beings of other living creatures is undoubtedly
the same as has been stated by Aristotle. On that account it is
allowed, even commanded, to kill animals; we are permitted to use
them according to our pleasure. The view that other living beings
are only governed by Divine Providence in the way described by
Aristotle, is supported by the words of the Prophet Habakkuk.
When he perceived the victories of Nebuchadnezzar, and saw the
multitude of those slain by him, he said," 0 God, it is as if men
were abandoned, neglected, and unprotected like fish and like
worms of the earth." He thus shows that these classes are
abandoned. This is expressed in the following passage:" And
makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that
have no ruler over them. They take up all of them with the angle,"
etc. (Hab. i. 14, 15). The prophet then declares that such is not the
case; for the events referred to are not the result of abandonment,
forsaking, and absence of Providence, but are intended as a
punishment for the people, who well deserved all that befell them.
He therefore says:" 0 Lord, Thou hast ordained them for judgment,
and 0 mighty God, Thou hast established them for correction"
(ibid. ver. 12). Our opinion is not contradicted by Scriptural
passages like the following:" He giveth to the beast his food" (Ps.
cxlvii. 9):" The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their
meat from God" (ibid. CiV. 2 1);" Thou openest thine hand, and
satisfiest the desire of every living thing" (ibid. cxlv. 16): or by the
saying of our Sages :" He sitteth and feedeth all, from the horns of
the unicorns even unto the eggs of insects." There are many similar
sayings extant in the writings of our Sages, but they imply nothing
that is contrary to my view. All these passages refer to Providence
in relation to species, and not to Providence in relation to
individual animals. The acts of God are as it were enumerated;
how He provides for every species the necessary food and the
means of subsistence. This is clear and plain. Aristotle likewise
holds that this kind of Providence is necessary, and is in actual
existence. Alexander also notices this fact in the name of Aristotle,
viz., that every species has its nourishment prepared for its
individual members; otherwise the species would undoubtedly
have perished. It does not require much consideration to
understand this. There is a rule laid down by our Sages that it is
directly prohibited in the Law to cause pain to an animal, and is
based on the words :" Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass ?"
etc. (Num. xxii. 32). But the object of this rule is to make us
perfect; that we should not assume cruel habits: and that we should
not uselessly cause pain to others: that, on the contrary, we should
be prepared to show pity and mercy to all living creatures, except
when necessity demands the contrary:" When thy soul longeth to
eat flesh," etc. (Deut. Xii. 20). We should not kill animals for the
purpose of practising cruelty, or for the purpose of play. It cannot
be objected to this theory, Why should God select mankind as the
object of His special Providence, and not other living beings ? For
he who asks this question must also inquire, Why has man alone,
of all species of animals, been endowed with intellect ? The
answer to this second question must be, according to the three
afore-mentioned theories : It was the Will of God, it is the decree
of His Wisdom, or it is in accordance with the laws of Nature. The
same answers apply to the first question. Understand thoroughly
my theory, that I do not ascribe to God ignorance of anything or
any kind of weakness; I hold that Divine Providence is related and
closely connected with the intellect, because Providence can only
proceed from an intelligent being, from a being that is itself the
most perfect Intellect. Those creatures, therefore, which receive
part of that intellectual influence. will become subject to the action
of Providence in the same proportion as they are acted upon by the
Intellect. This theory is in accordance with reason and with the
teaching of Scripture, whilst the other theories previously
mentioned either exaggerate Divine Providence or detract from it.
In the former case they lead to confusion and entire nonsense, and
cause us to deny reason and to contradict that which is perceived
with the senses. The latter case, viz., the theory that Divine
Providence does not extend to man, and that there is no difference
between man and other animals, implies very bad notions about
God; it disturbs all social order, removes and destroys all the moral
and intellectual virtues of man.
