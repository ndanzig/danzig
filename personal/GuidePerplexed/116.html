THE word zur (rock) is a homonym. First, it denotes rock," as"
And thou shalt smite the rock" (zur) (Exod. xvii. 6). Then, hard
stone," like the flint, e.g.," Knives of stone" (zurim) (josh. V. 2).
It is next employed to signify the quarry from which the stones are
hewn; comp." Look unto the rock (zur) whence ye are hewn" (Isa.
li. 1). From this latter meaning of the term another figurative
notion was subsequently derived, viz.," the root and origin" of all
things. It is on this account that after the words" Look to the rock
whence ye are hewn," the Prophet continues," Look unto Abraham
your father," from which we evidently may infer that the words"
Abraham your father" serve to explain" the rock whence ye are
hewn" : and that the Prophet meant to say," Walk in his ways, put
faith in his instruction, and conduct yourselves according to the
rule of his life ! for the properties contained in the quarry should
be found again in those things which are formed and hewn out of
it."
It is in the latter sense that the Almighty is called" rock," He being
the origin and the causa efficiens of all things besides Himself.
Thus we read," He is the Rock, His work is perfect" (Deut. xxxii.
4):" Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful" (Dent. xxxii.
18):" Their Rock had sold them 11 (-xi- 30):" There is no rock
like our God" (I Sam. ii. 2):" The Rock of Eternity" (Isa. xxvi. 4).
Again," And thou shalt stand upon the Rock" (Exod. xxxiii. 21),
i.e., Be firm and steadfast in the conviction that God is the source
of all things, for this will lead you towards the knowledge of the
Divine Being. We have shown (chap. viii.) that the words" Behold,
a place is with me" (Exod. xxxiii. 21) contain the same idea.
