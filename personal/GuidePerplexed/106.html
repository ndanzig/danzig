THE two Hebrew nouns ish and ishshah were originally employed
to designate the" male and female" of human beings, but were
afterwards applied to the" male and female" of the other species
of the animal creation. For instance, we read," Of every clean
beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens," ish ve-ishto (Gen. Vii. 2),
in the same sense as ish ve-ishshah," male and female." The term
zakar u-nekebah was afterwards applied to anything designed and
prepared for union with another object Thus we read," The five
curtains shall be coupled together, one (ishshah) to the other"
(ahotah) (Exod. xxvi. 3).
It will easily be seen that the Hebrew equivalents for" brother and
sister" are likewise treated as homonyms, and used, in a figurative
sense, like ish and ishshah.
