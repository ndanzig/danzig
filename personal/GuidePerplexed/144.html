THE Hebrew ayin is a homonym, signifying" fountain" ; e.g.," By
a fountain (,en) of water" (Gen. xvi. 7). It next denotes" eye" :
comp. ('ayin)" Eye for eye" (Exod. xxi. 24). Another meaning of
the word is" providence," as it is said concerning Jeremiah," Take
him and direct thine attention (eneka) to him" (Jer. xxxix. 12). In
this figurative sense it is to be understood when used in reference
to God; e.g.," And my providence and my pleasure shall be there
perpetually" (I Kings ix. 3), as we have already explained (page
140):" The eyes ('ene), i.e., the Providence of the Lord thy God,
are always upon it" (Deut. xi. 12):" They are the eyes ('ene) of the
Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth" (Zech. iv. 10),
i.e., His providence is extended over everything that is on earth, as
will be explained in the chapters in which we shall treat of
Providence. When, however, the word" eye" is connected with
the verb" to see," (raah or hazah) as in" Open thine eyes, and see"
(I Kings xix. 16):" His eyes behold" (Ps. xi. 4), the phrase denotes
perception of the mind, not that of the senses: for every sensation
is a passive state, as is well known to you, and God is active, never
passive, as will be explained by me.
