IT is well known that there are men whose face is like that of other
animals thus the face of some person is like that of a lion, that of
another person like that of an ox, and so on: and man's face is
described according as the form of his face resembles the form of
the face of other animals. By the expressions," the face of an ox,""
the face of a lion,"" the face of an eagle" (Ezek, i. 10), the
prophet describes a human face inclining towards the forms of
these various species. This interpretation can be supported by two
proofs. First, the prophet says of the Hayyot in general that" their
appearance is this, they have the form of man" (ver. 5), and then
in describing each of the Hayyot he attributes to them the face of a
man, that of an ox, that of a lion, and that of an eagle. Secondly, in
the second description of the Chariot, which is intended as a
supplement to the first, the prophet says, Each hath four faces; the
one is the face of a cherub, the second a man's face, the third a
lion's face, and the fourth that of an eagle (ibid. x. W. He thus
clearly indicates that the terms" the face of an ox" and" the face
of a cherub" are identical. But cherub designates" a youth." By
analogy we explain the two other terms-" the face of a lion" and"
the face of an eagle" in the same manner." The face of the ox" has
been singled out on account of the etymology of the Hebrew term
shor (ox), as has been indicated by me. It is impossible to assume
that this second description refers to the perception of another
prophetic vision, because it concludes thus" This is the Hayyah
which I saw at the river Chebar" (ibid. ver. 15). What we intended
to explain is now clear.
