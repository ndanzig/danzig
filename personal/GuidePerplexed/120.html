THE word ram (high) is a homonym, denoting elevation in space,
and elevation in dignity, i.e., greatness, honour, and power. It has
the first meaning in" And the ark was lifted up (va-tarom) above
the earth" (Gen. vii. 17): and the latter meaning in" I have exalted
(harimoti) one chosen out of the people" (Ps. lxxxix. 20;"
Forasmuch as I have exalted (harimoti) thee from amongst the
dust" (I Kings xvi. 2):" Forasmuch as I exalted (harimott) thee
from among the people" (I Kings xiv. 7).
Whenever this term is employed in reference to God, it must be
taken in the second sense :" Be thou exalted (rumah), 0 God,
above the heavens" (Ps. lvii.12). In the same manner does the root
nasa (to Eft up) denote both elevation in space and elevation in
rank and dignity. In the former sense it occurs in And they lifted
up (va-yisseu) their corn upon their asses" (Gen. xlii. 26) and there
are many instances like this in which this verb has the meaning to
carry,"" to move" from place to place: for this implies elevation
in space. In the second sense we have" And his kingdom shall be
exalted" (ve-tinnase) (Num. xxiv. 7):" And he bare them, and
carried them" (va-yenasseem) (Isa. Ixiii. 9):" Wherefore do ye
exalt yourselves" (titnasseu) (Num. xvi. 3).
Every form of this verb when applied to God has this latter sense --
e.g.," Lift up thyself (hinnase), thou judge of the earth" (PS.
XCiV. 2):" Thus saith the High (ram) and Exalted (nisia) One"
(Isa. Ivii. 15) -- denoting elevation in rank, quality, and power, and
not elevation in space.
You may be surprised that I employ the expression," elevation in
rank, quality, and power," and you may say," How can you assert
that several distinct expressions denote the same thing ?" It will be
explained later on (chap. 1. seqq.) that those who possess a true
knowledge of God do not consider that He possesses many
attributes, but believe that these various attributes which describe
His Might, Greatness, Power, Perfection, Goodness, etc., are
identical, denoting His Essence, and not anything extraneous to
His Essence. 1 shall devote special chapters to the Names and
Attributes of
God; our intention here is solely to show that" high and exalted"
in the passage quoted denote elevation in rank, not in space.
