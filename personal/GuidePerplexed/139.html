THE Hebrew leb (heart) is a homonymous noun, signifying that
organ which is the source of life to all beings possessing a heart.
Comp." And thrust them through the heart of Absalom" (I Sam.
xviii. 14).
This organ being in the middle of the body, the word has been
figuratively applied to express" the middle part of a thing."
Comp." unto the midst (leb) of heaven" (Deut. iv.11):" the midst
(labbath) of fire" (Exod. iii. 2).
It further denotes" thought." Comp." Went not mine heart with
thee ?" (2 Kings V. 26), i.e., I was with thee in my thought when a
certain event happened. Similarly must be explained," And that ye
seek not after your own heart" (Num. xv, 39), i.e., after your own
thoughts: Whose heart (i.e., whose thought), turneth away this day"
(Deut. xxix. is).
The word further signifies" counsel." Comp." All the rest of Israel
were of one heart (i.e., had one plan) to make David king" (I
Chron. xii. 38):" but fools die for want of heart," i.e., of counsel;"
My heart (i.e., my counsel) shall not turn away from this so long as
I live" (job xxvii. 6): for this sentence is preceded by the words,
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go" : and then
follows, my heart shall never turn away from this." -- As regards
the expression yeheraf, I think that it may be compared with the
same verb in the form nehrefet," a handmaid betrothed (nehrefet)
to a man" (Lev. XiX. 20), where nehefeth is similar in meaning to
the Arabic munharifat," turning away," and signifies" turning from
the state of slavery to that of marriage."
Leh (heart) denotes also" will" : comp." And I shall give you
pastors according to my will (libbi)" (Jer. iii. 15)," Is thine heart
right as my heart is ?" (2 Kings x. 15), i.e., is thy will right as my
will is ? In this sense the word has been figuratively applied to
God. Comp." That shall do according to that which is in mine
heart and in my soul" (I Sam. ii. 35), i.e., according to My will;"
And mine eyes and mine heart (i.e., My providence and My will)
shall be there perpetually" (I Kings ix. 3).
The word is also used in the sense of" understanding." Comp." For
vain man will be endowed with a heart" Uob xi. 12), i.e., will be
wise;" A wise man's heart is at his right hand" (Eccles. X. 2), i.e.,
his understanding is engaged in perfect thoughts, the highest
problems. Instances of this kind are numerous. It is in this sense,
namely, that of understanding, that the word is used whenever
figuratively applied to God; but exceptionally it is also used in the
sense of" will." It must, in each passage, be explained in
accordance with the context. Also, in the following and similar
passages, it signifies" understanding" :" Consider it in thine heart"
(Deut. iv. 39):" And none considereth in his heart" (Isa. xliv. 19).
Thus, also," Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive,"
is identical in its meaning with" Unto thee it was shown that thou
mightest know" (Deut. iv. 35).
As to the passage," And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thine heart" (Ib. vi. 5), 1 explain" with all thine heart" to mean"
with all the powers of thine heart," that is, with all the powers of
the body, for they all have their origin in the heart: and the sense of
the entire passage is : make the knowledge of God the aim of all
thy actions, as we have stated in our Commentary on the Mishnah
(Aboth, Eight Chapters, v.), and in our Mishneh Torah, yesode
hatorah, chap. ii. 2.
