Letter of the Author to his Pupil, R. Joseph Ibn Aknin:<BR>
In the name of GOD, Lord of the Universe.<BR>
To R. Joseph (may God protect him!), son of R. Jehudah (may his
repose be in Paradise !) :<BR>
My dear pupil, ever since you resolved to come to me, from a
distant country, and to study under my direction, I thought highly
of your thirst for knowledge, and your fondness for speculative
pursuits, which found expression in your poems. I refer to the time
when I received your writings in prose and verse from Alexandria.
I was then not yet able to test your powers of apprehension, and I
thought that your desire might possibly exceed your capacity. But
when you had gone with me through a course of astronomy, after
having completed the [other] elementary studies which are
indispensable for the understanding of that science, 1 was still
more gratified by the acuteness and the quickness of your
apprehension. Observing your great fondness for mathematics, I let
you study them more deeply, for I felt sure of your ultimate
success. Afterwards, when I took you through a course of logic, 1
found that my great expectations of you were confirmed, and I
considered you fit to receive from me an exposition of the esoteric
ideas contained in the prophetic books, that you might understand
them as they are understood by men of culture. When I
commenced by way of hints, 1 noticed that you desired additional
explanation, urging me to expound some metaphysical problems;
to teach you the system of the Mutakallemim; to tell you whether
their arguments were based on logical proof; and if not, what their
method was. I perceived that you had acquired some knowledge in
those matters from others, and that you were perplexed and
bewildered; yet you sought to find out a solution to your difficulty.
I urged you to desist from this pursuit, and enjoined you to
continue your studies systematically; for my object was that the
truth should present itself in connected order, and that you should
not hit upon it by mere chance. Whilst you studied with me I never
refused to explain difficult verses in the Bible or passages in
rabbinical literature which we happened to meet. When, by the
will of God, we parted, and you went your way, our discussions
aroused in me a resolution which had long been dormant. Your
absence has prompted me to compose this treatise for you and for
those who are like you, however few they may be. I have divided it
into chapters, each of which shall be sent to you as soon as it is
completed. Farewell!"<P>
Prefatory Remarks:<BR>
Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for I lift up my
soul unto Thee." (Psalm cxliii. S.)<BR>
Unto you, 0 men, 1 call, and my voice is to the sons of men."
(Prov. viii. 4)<BR>
Bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise, and apply
thine heart unto my knowledge." (Prov. xxii. 17.)<BR>
My primary object in this work is to explain certain words
occurring in the prophetic books. Of these some are homonyms,
and of their several meanings the ignorant choose the wrong ones;
other terms which are employed in a figurative sense are
erroneously taken by such persons in their primary signification.
There are also hybrid terms, denoting things which are of the same
class from one point of view and of a different class from another.
It is not here intended to explain all these expressions to the
unlettered or to mere tyros, a previous knowledge of Logic and
Natural Philosophy being indispensable, or to those who confine
their attention to the study of our holy Law, I mean the study of the
canonical law alone; for the true knowledge of the Torah is the
special aim of this and similar works.<BR>
The object of this treatise is to enlighten a religious man who has
been trained to believe in the truth of our holy Law, who
conscientiously fulfils his moral and religious duties, and at the
same time has been successful in his philosophical studies. Human
reason has attracted him to abide within its sphere; and he finds it
difficult to accept as correct the teaching based on the literal
interpretation of the Law, and especially that which he himself or
others derived from those homonymous, metaphorical, or hybrid
expressions. Hence he is lost in perplexity and anxiety. If he be
guided solely by reason, and renounce his previous views which
are based on those expressions, he would consider that he had
rejected the fundamental principles of the Law; and even if he
retains the opinions which were derived from those expressions,
and if, instead of following his reason, he abandon its guidance
altogether, it would still appear that his religious convictions had
suffered loss and injury. For he would then be left with those errors
which give rise to fear and anxiety, constant grief and great
perplexity.<BR>
This work has also a second object in view. It seeks to explain
certain obscure figures which occur in the Prophets, and are not
distinctly characterized as being figures. Ignorant and superficial
readers take them in a literal, not in a figurative sense. Even well
informed persons are bewildered if they understand these passages
in their literal signification, but they are entirely relieved of their
perplexity when we explain the figure, or merely suggest that the
terms are figurative. For this reason I have called this book Guide
for the Perplexed.<BR>
I do not presume to think that this treatise settles every doubt in
the minds of those who understand it, but I maintain that it settles
the greater part of their difficulties. No intelligent man will require
and expect that on introducing any subject 1 shall completely
exhaust it; or that on commencing the exposition of a figure I shall
fully explain all its parts. Such a course could not be followed by a
teacher in a viva vote exposition, much less by an author in writing
a book, without becoming a target for every foolish conceited
person to discharge the arrows of folly at him. Some general
principles bearing upon this point have been fully discussed in our
works on the Talmud, and we have there called the attention of the
reader to many themes of this kind. We also stated (Mishneh torah,
I. ii. 12, and iv. 10) that the expression Ma'ase Bereshit (Account
of the Creation) signified" Natural Science," and Ma'aseh
Mercabah (" Description of the Chariot" ) Metaphysics, and we
explained the force of the Rabbinical dictum," The Ma'aseh
Mercabak must not be fully expounded even in the presence of a
single student, unless he be wise and able to reason for himself,
and even then you should merely acquaint him with the heads of
the different sections of the subject. (Babyl. Talm. Hagigah, fol. II
b). You must, therefore, not expect from me more than such heads.
And even these have not been methodically and systematically
arranged in this work, but have been, on the contrary, scattered,
and are interspersed with other topics which we shall have
occasion to explain. My object in adopting this arrangement is that
the truths should be at one time apparent, and at another time
concealed. Thus we shall not be in opposition to the Divine Will
(from which it is wrong to deviate) which has withheld from the
multitude the truths required for the knowledge of God, according
to the words," The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him"
(Ps. xxv. 14).<BR>
Know that also in Natural Science there are topics which are not to
be fully explained. Our Sages laid down the rule," The Ma'aseb
Bereshith must not be expounded in the presence of two." If an
author were to explain these principles in writing, it would be
equal to expounding them unto thousands of men. For this reason
the prophets treat these subjects in figures, and our Sages,
imitating the method of Scripture, speak of them in metaphors and
allegories; because there is a close affinity between these subjects
and metaphysics, and indeed they form part of its mysteries. Do
not imagine that these most difficult problems can be thoroughly
understood by any one of us. This is not the case. At times the
truth shines so brilliantly that we perceive it as clear as day. Our
nature and habit then draw a veil over our perception, and we
return to a darkness almost as dense as before. We are like those
who, though beholding frequent flashes of lightning, still find
themselves in the thickest darkness of the night. On some the
lightning flashes in rapid succession, and they seem to be in
continuous light, and their night is as clear as the day. This was the
degree of prophetic excellence attained by (Moses) the greatest of
prophets, to whom God said," But as for thee, stand thou here by
Me" (Deut. v. 31), and of whom it is written" the skin of his face
shone," etc. (Exod. xxxiv. 29). [Some perceive the prophetic flash
at long intervals; this is the degree of most prophets.] By others
only once during the whole night is a flash of lightning perceived.
This is the case with those of whom we are informed," They
prophesied, and did not prophesy again" (Num. xi. 25). There are
some to whom the flashes of lightning appear with varying
intervals; others are in the condition of men, whose darkness is
illumined not by lightning, but by some kind of crystal or similar
stone, or other substances that possess the property of shining
during the night; and to them even this small amount of light is not
continuous, but now it shines and now it vanishes, as if it were" the
flame of the rotating sword."<BR>
The degrees in the perfection of men vary according to these
distinctions. Concerning those who never beheld the light even for
one day, but walk in continual darkness, it is written," They know
not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness" (Ps.
lxxxii. 5). Truth, in spite of all its powerful manifestations, is
completely withheld from them, and the following words of
Scripture may be applied to them," And now men see not the light
which is bright in the skies" (job xxxvii. 21). They are the
multitude of ordinary men: there is no need to notice them in this
treatise.<BR>
You must know that if a person, who has attained a certain degree
of perfection, wishes to impart to others, either orally or in writing,
any portion of the knowledge which he has acquired of these
subjects, he is utterly unable to be as systematic and explicit as he
could be in a science of which the method is well known. The
same difficulties which he encountered when investigating the
subject for himself will attend him when endeavouring to instruct
others: viz., at one time the explanation will appear lucid, at
another time, obscure: this property of the subject appears to
remain the same both to the advanced scholar and to the beginner.
For this reason, great theological scholars gave instruction in all
such matters only by means of metaphors and allegories. They
frequently employed them in forms varying more or less
essentially. In most cases they placed the lesson to be illustrated at
the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end of the simile. When
they could find no simile which from beginning to end
corresponded to the idea which was to be illustrated, they divided
the subject of the lesson, although in itself one whole, into
different parts, and expressed each by a separate figure. Still more
obscure are those instances in which one simile is employed to
illustrate many subjects, the beginning of the simile representing
one thing, the end another. Sometimes the whole metaphor may
refer to two cognate subjects in the same branch of knowledge.
If we were to teach in these disciplines, without the use of parables
and figures, we should be compelled to resort to expressions both
profound and transcendental, and by no means more intelligible
than metaphors and similes: as though the wise and learned were
drawn into this course by the Divine Will, in the same way as they
are compelled to follow the laws of nature in matters relating to
the body. You are no doubt aware that the Almighty, desiring to
lead us to perfection and to improve our state of society, has
revealed to us laws which are to regulate our actions. These laws,
however, presuppose an advanced state of intellectual culture. We
must first form a conception of the Existence of the Creator
according to our capabilities; that is, we must have a knowledge of
Metaphysics. But this discipline can only be approached after the
study of Physics: for the science of Physics borders on
Metaphysics, and must even precede it in the course of our studies,
as is clear to all who are familiar with these questions. Therefore
the Almighty commenced Holy Writ with the description of the
Creation, that is, with Physical Science; the subject being on the
one hand most weighty and important, and on the other hand our
means of fully comprehending those great problems being limited.
He described those profound truths, which His Divine Wisdom
found it necessary to communicate to us, in allegorical, figurative,
and metaphorical language. Our Sages have said (Yemen Midrash
on Gen. i. 1)," It is impossible to give a full account of the
Creation to man. Therefore Scripture simply tells us, In the
beginning God created the heavens and the earth" (Gen. i. 1).
Thus they have suggested that this subject is a deep mystery, and
in the words of Solomon," Far off and exceedingly deep, who can
find it out ?" (Eccles. Vii. 24). It has been treated in metaphors in
order that the uneducated may comprehend it according to the
measure of their faculties and the feebleness of their apprehension,
while educated persons may take it in a different sense. In our
commentary on the Mishnah we stated our intention to explain
difficult problems in the Book on Prophecy and in the Book of
Harmony. In the latter we intended to examine all the passages in
the Midrash which, if taken literally, appear to be inconsistent with
truth and common sense, and must therefore be taken figuratively.
Many years have elapsed since 1 first commenced those works. I
had proceeded but a short way when 1 became dissatisfied with
my original plan. For I observed that by expounding these passages
by means of allegorical and mystical terms, we do not explain
anything, but merely substitute one thing for another of the same
nature, whilst in explaining them fully our efforts would displease
most people; and my sole object in planning to write those books
was to make the contents of Midrashirn and the exoteric lessons of
the prophecies intelligible to everybody. We have further noticed
that when an ill-informed Theologian reads these Midrashim, he
will find no difficulty; for possessing no knowledge of the
properties of things, he will not reject statements which involve
impossibilities. When, however, a person who is both religious and
well educated reads them, he cannot escape the following
dilemma: either he takes them literally, and questions the abilities
of the author and the soundness of his mind-doing thereby nothing
which is opposed to the principles of our faith,-- or he will
acquiesce in assuming that the passages in question have some
secret meaning, and he will continue to hold the author in high
estimation whether he understood the allegory or not. As regards
prophecy in its various degrees and the different metaphors used in
the prophetic books, we shall give in the present work an
explanation, according to a different method. Guided by these
considerations I have refrained from writing those two books as I
had previously intended. In my larger work, the Mishnab Torah, I
have contented myself with briefly stating the principles of our
faith and its fundamental truths, together with such hints as
approach a clear exposition. In this work, however, I address those
who have studied philosophy and have acquired sound knowledge,
and who while firm in religious matters are perplexed and
bewildered on account of the ambiguous and figurative
expressions employed in the holy writings. Some chapters may be
found in this work which contain no reference whatever to
homonyms. Such chapters will serve as an introduction to others:
they will contain some reference to the signification of a homonym
which 1 do not wish to mention in that place, or explain some
figure: point out that a certain expression is a figure: treat of
difficult passages generally misunderstood in consequence of the
homonymy they include, or because the simile they contain is
taken in place of that which it represents, and vice versa.
Having spoken of similes, I proceed to make the following remark
:-The key to the understanding and to the full comprehension of all
that the Prophets have said is found in the knowledge of the
figures, their general ideas, and the meaning of each word they
contain. You know the verse:
" I have also spoken in similes by the Prophets" (Hosea xii. 10):
and also the verse," Put forth a riddle and speak a parable" (Ezek.
xvii. 2). And because the Prophets continually employ figures,
Ezekiel said," Does He not speak parables ?" (xxi. 5). Again,
Solomon begins his book of Proverbs with the words," To
understand a proverb and figurative speech, the words of the wise
and their dark sayings" (Prov. i. 6): and we read in Midrash, Shir
ha-shirim Rabba, i. 1):" To what were the words of the Law to be
cornpared before the time of Solomon ? To a well the waters of
which are at a great depth, and though cool and fresh, yet no man
could drink of them. A clever man joined cord with cord, and rope
with rope, and drew up and drank. So Solomon went from figure
to figure, and from subject to subject, till he obtained the true
sense of the Law." So far go the words of our Sages. I do not
believe that any intelligent man thinks that" the words of the Law"
mentioned here as requiring the application of figures in order to
be understood, can refer to the rules for building tabernacles, for
preparing the lulab, or for the four kinds of trustees. What is really
meant is the apprehension of profound and difficult subjects,
concerning which our Sages said," If a man loses in his house a
sela, or a pearl, he can find it by lighting a taper worth only one
issar. Thus the parables in themselves are of no great value, but
through them the words of the holy Law are rendered intelligible."
These likewise are the words of our Sages; consider well their
statement, that the deeper sense of the words of the holy Law are
pearls, and the literal acceptation of a figure is of no value in itself.
They compare the hidden meaning included in the literal sense of
the simile to a pearl lost in a dark room, which is full of furniture.
It is certain that the pearl is in the room, but the man can neither
see it nor know where it lies. It is just as if the pearl were no
longer in his possession, for, as has been stated, it affords him no
benefit whatever until he kindles a light. The same is the case with
the comprehension of that which the simile represents. The wise
king said," A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in vessels of
silver" (Prov. xxv. 11). Hear the explanation of what he said :-The
word maskiyotb, the Hebrew equivalent for" vessels," denotes"
filigree network" --i.e., things in which there are very small
apertures, such as are frequently wrought by silversmiths. They are
called in Hebrew maskiyyoth (lit." transpicuous," from the verb
sakah," he saw," a root which occurs also in the Targum of
Onkelos, Gen. xxvi. 8), because the eye penetrates through them.
Thus Solomon meant to say," just as apples of gold in silver
filigree with small apertures, so is a word fitly spoken."
See how beautifully the conditions of a good simile are described
in this figure! It shows that in every word which has a double
sense, a literal one and a figurative one, the plain meaning must be
as valuable as silver, and the hidden meaning still more precious:
so that the figurative meaning bears the same relation to the literal
one as gold to silver. It is further necessary that the plain sense of
the phrase shall give to those who consider it some notion of that
which the figure represents. just as a golden apple overlaid with a
network of silver, when seen at a distance, or looked at
superficially, is mistaken for a silver apple, but when a
keen-sighted person looks at the object well, he will find what is
within, and see that the apple is gold. The same is the case with the
figures employed by prophets. Taken literally, such expressions
contain wisdom useful for many purposes, among others, for the
amelioration of the condition of society; e.g., the Proverbs (of
Solomon), and similar sayings in their literal sense. Their hidden
meaning, however, is profound wisdom, conducive to the
recognition of real truth.<BR>
Know that the figures employed by prophets are of two kinds :
first, where every word which occurs in the simile represents a
certain idea: and secondly, where the simile, as a whole, represents
a general idea, but has a great many points which have no
reference whatever to that idea: they are simply required to give to
the simile its proper form and order, or better to conceal the idea:
the simile is therefore continued as far as necessary, according to
its literal sense. Consider this well.<BR>
An example of the first class of prophetic figures is to be found in
Genesis:-"And, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of
it reached to heaven; and, behold, the angels of God ascending and
descending on it" (Gen. xxviii. 12). The word" ladder" refers to
one idea:" set up on the earth" to another:" and the top of it
reached to heaven" to a third: 4' angels of God" to a fourth:"
ascending" to a fifth;" descending" to a sixth;" the Lord stood
above it" (ver. 13) to a seventh. Every word in this figure
introduces a fresh element into the idea represented by the figure.
An example of the second class of prophetic figures is found in
Proverbs (vii. 6-26) :--" For at the window of my house I looked
through my casement, and beheld among the simple ones; I
discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,
passing through the street near her corner : and he went the way to
her house, in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark
night: and, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a
harlot, and subtil of heart. (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide
not in her house: now the is without, now in the streets, and lieth in
wait in every corner.) So she caught him, and kissed him, and with
an impudent face said unto him, I have peace offerings with me;
this day have I paid my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet thee,
diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee. I have decked
my bed with coverings of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yam
of Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and
cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let
us solace ourselves with loves. For the goodman is not at home, he
is gone a long journey: he hath taken a bag of money with him, and
will come home at the day appointed. With her much fair speech
she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced
him. He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the
slaughter, or as fetters to the correction of a fool : till a dart strike
through his liver: as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not
that it is for his life. Hearken unto me now therefore, 0 ye children,
and attend to the words of my mouth. Let not thine heart decline to
her ways, go not astray in her paths. For she hath cast down many
wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her."
The general principle expounded in all these verses is to abstain
from excessive indulgence in bodily pleasures. The author
compares the body, which is the source of all sensual pleasures, to
a married woman who at the same time is a harlot. And this figure
he has taken as the basis of his entire book. We shall hereafter
show the wisdom of Solomon in comparing sensual pleasures to an
adulterous harlot. We shall explain how aptly he concludes that
work with the praises of a faithful wife who devotes herself to the
welfare of her husband and of her household. All obstacles which
prevent man from attaining his highest aim in life, all the
deficiencies in the character of man, all his evil propensities, are to
be traced to the body alone. This will be explained later on. The
predominant idea running throughout the figure is, that man shall
not be entirely guided by his animal, or material nature; for the
material substance of man is identical with that of the brute
creation.<BR>
An adequate explanation of the figure having been given, and its
meaning having been shown, do not imagine that you will find in
its application a corresponding element for each part of the figure;
you must not ask what is meant by" I have peace offerings with
me" (ver. 14): by" I have decked my bed with coverings of
tapestry" (ver. 16): or what is added to the force of the figure by
the observation" for the goodman is not at home" (ver. 19), and
so on to the end of the chapter. For all this is merely to complete
the illustration of the metaphor in its literal meaning. The
circumstances described here are such as are common to
adulterers. Such conversations take place between all adulterous
persons. You must well understand what I have said, for it is a
principle of the utmost importance with respect to those things
which I intend to expound. If you observe in one of the chapters
that I explained the meaning of a certain figure, and pointed out to
you its general scope, do not trouble yourself further in order to
find an interpretation of each separate portion, for that would lead
you to one of the two following erroneous courses: either you will
miss the sense included in the metaphor, or you will be induced to
explain certain things which require no explanation, and which are
not introduced for that purpose. Through this unnecessary trouble
you may fall into the great error which besets most modern sects in
their foolish writings and discussions: they all endeavour to find
some hidden meaning in expressions which were never uttered by
the author in that sense. Your object should be to discover inmost
of the figures the general idea which the author wishes to express.
In some instances it will be sufficient if you understand from my
remarks that a certain expression contains a figure, although I may
offer no further comment. For when you know that it is not to be
taken literally, you will understand at once to what subject it
refers. My statement that it is a figurative expression will, as it
were, remove the screen from between the object and the observer.<P>
Directions for the Study of this Work:<BR>
If you desire to grasp all that is contained in this book so that
nothing shall escape your notice, consider the chapters in
connected order. In studying each chapter, do not content yourself
with comprehending its principal subject, but attend to every term
mentioned therein, although it may seem to have no connection
with the principal subject. For what I have written in this work was
not the suggestion of the moment: it is the result of deep study and
great application. Care has been taken that nothing that appeared
doubtful should be left unexplained. Nothing of what is mentioned
is out of place, every remark will be found to illustrate the
subject-matter of the respective chapter. Do not read superficially,
lest you do me an injury, and derive no benefit for yourself. You
must study thoroughly and read continually; for you will then find
the solution of those important problems of religion, which are a
source of anxiety to all intelligent men. I adjure any reader of my
book, in the name of the Most High, not to add any explanation
even to a single word: nor to explain to another any portion of it
except such passages as have been fully treated of by previous
theological authorities: he must not teach others anything that he
has learnt from my work alone, and that has not been hitherto
discussed by any of our authorities. The reader must, moreover,
beware of raising objections to any of my statements, because it is
very probable that he may understand my words to mean the exact
opposite to what 1 intended to say. He will injure me, while I
endeavoured to benefit him." He will requite me evil for good."
Let the reader make a careful study of this work; and if his doubt
be removed on even one point, let him praise his Maker and rest
contented with the knowledge he has acquired. But if he derive
from it no benefit whatever, he may consider the book as if it had
never been written. Should he notice any opinions with which he
does not agree, let him endeavour to find a suitable explanation,
even if it seem far-fetched, in order that he may judge me
charitably. Such a duty we owe to every one. We owe it especially
to our scholars and theologians, who endeavour to teach us what is
the truth according to the best of their ability. I feel assured that
those of my readers who have not studied philosophy, will still
derive profit from many a chapter. But the thinker whose studies
have brought him into collision with religion, will, as I have
already mentioned, derive much benefit from every chapter. How
greatly will he rejoice! How agreeably will my words strike his
ears! Those, however, whose minds are confused with false
notions and perverse methods, who regard their misleading studies
as sciences, and imagine themselves philosophers, though they
have no knowledge that could truly be termed science, will object
to many chapters, and will find in them many insuperable
difficulties, because they do not understand their meaning, and
because I expose therein the absurdity of their perverse notions,
which constitute their riches and peculiar treasure," stored up for
their ruin." God knows that 1 hesitated very much before writing
on the subjects contained in this work, since they are profound
mysteries: they are topics which, since the time of our captivity
have not been treated by any of our scholars as far as we possess
their writings; how then shall I now make a beginning and discuss
them ? But I rely on two precedents : first, to similar cases our
Sages applied the verse," It is time to do something in honour of
the Lord: for they have made void thy law" (Ps. cxix. 126).
Secondly, they have said," Let all thy acts be guided by pure
intentions." On these two principles I relied while composing some
parts of this work. Lastly, when I have a difficult subject before
me-when I find the road narrow, and can see no other way of
teaching a well established truth except by pleasing one intelligent
man and displeasing ten thousand fools-I prefer to address myself
to the one man, and to take no notice whatever of the
condemnation of the multitude; I prefer to extricate that intelligent
man from his embarrassment and show him the cause of his
perplexity, so that he may attain perfection and be at peace.<P>
On method:<BR>
THERE are seven causes of inconsistencies and contradictions to
be met with in a literary work. The first cause arises from the fact
that the author collects the opinions of various men, each differing
from the other, but neglects to mention the name of the author of
any particular opinion. In such a work contradictions or
inconsistencies must occur, since any two statements may belong
to two different authors. Second cause: The author holds at first
one opinion which he subsequently rejects: in his work., however,
both his original and altered views are retained. Third cause: The
passages in question are not all to be taken literally: some only are
to be understood in their literal sense, while in others figurative
language is employed, which includes another meaning besides the
literal one : or, in the apparently inconsistent passages, figurative
language is employed which, if taken literally, would seem to be
contradictories or contraries. Fourth cause : The premises are not
identical in both statements, but for certain reasons they are not
fully stated in these passages: or two propositions with different
subjects which are expressed by the same term without having the
difference in meaning pointed out, occur in two passages. The
contradiction is therefore only apparent, but there is no
contradiction in reality. The fifth cause is traceable to the use of a
certain method adopted in teaching and expounding profound
problems. Namely, a difficult and obscure theorem must
sometimes be mentioned and assumed as known, for the
illustration of some elementary and intelligible subject which must
be taught beforehand the commencement being always made with
the easier thing. The teacher must therefore facilitate, in any
manner which he can devise, the explanation of those theorems,
which have to be assumed as known, and he must content himself
with giving a general though somewhat inaccurate notion on the
subject. It is, for the present, explained according to the capacity of
the students, that they may comprehend it as far as they are
required to understand the subject. Later on, the same subject is
thoroughly treated and fully developed in its right place. Sixth
cause : The contradiction is not apparent, and only becomes
evident through a series of premises. The larger the number of
premises necessary to prove the contradiction between the two
conclusions, the greater is the chance that it will escape detection,
and that the author will not perceive his own inconsistency. Only
when from each conclusion, by means of suitable premises, an
inference is made, and from the enunciation thus inferred, by
means of proper arguments, other conclusions are formed, and
after that process has been repeated many times, then it becomes
clear that the original conclusions are contradictories or contraries.
Even able writers are liable to overlook such inconsistencies. If,
however, the contradiction between the original statements can at
once be discovered, and the author, while writing the second, does
not think of the first, he evinces a greater deficiency, and his words
deserve no notice whatever. Seventh cause: Itis sometimes
necessary to introduce such metaphysical matter as may partly be
disclosed, but must partly be concealed: while, therefore, on one
occasion the object which the author has in view may demand that
the metaphysical problem be treated as solved in one way, it may
be convenient on another occasion to treat it as solved in the
opposite way. The author must endeavour, by concealing the fact
as much as possible, to prevent the uneducated reader from
perceiving the contradiction.<BR>
Inconsistencies occurring in the Mishnah and Boraitot are
traceable to the first cause. You meet frequently in the Gemara
with passages like the following : --" Does not the beginning of the
passage contradict the end ? No: the beginning is the dictum of a
certain Rabbi: the end that of an other" : or" Rabbi (Jehudah
ha-Nasi) approved of the opinion of a certain rabbi in one case and
gave it therefore anonymously, and having accepted that of another
rabbi in the other case he introduced that view without naming the
authority" : or" Who is the author of this anonymous dictum ?
Rabbi A."" Who is the author of that paragraph in the Mishnah?
Rabbi B." Instances of this kind are innumerable.<BR>
Apparent contradictions or differences occurring in the Gemara
may be traced to the first cause and to the second, as e.g.," In this
particular case he agrees with this rabbi or" He agrees with him in
one point, but differs from him in another" or" These two dicta
are the opinions of two Amoraim, who differ as regards the
statement made by a certain rabbi." These are examples of
contradictions traceable to the first cause. The following are
instances which may be traced to the second cause." Rabba
altered his opinion on that point" : it then becomes necessary to
consider which of the two opinions came second. Again," In the
first recension of the Talmud by Rabbi Ashi, he made one
assertion, and in the second a different one."<BR>
The inconsistencies and contradictions met with in some passages
of the prophetic books, if taken literally, are all traceable to the
third or fourth cause, and it is exclusively in reference to this
subject that I wrote the present Introduction. You know that the
following expression frequently occurs," One verse says this,
another that," showing the contradiction, and explaining that either
some premise is wanting or the subject is altered. Comp."
Solomon, it is not sufficient that thy words contradict thy father:
they are themselves inconsistent, etc." Many similar instances
occur in the writings of our Sages. The passages in the prophetical
books which our Sages have explained, mostly refer to religious or
moral precepts. Our desire, however, is to discuss such passages as
contain apparent contradictions in regard to the principles of our
faith. I shall explain some of them in various chapters of the
present work: for this subject also belongs to the secrets of the
Torah.<BR>
Contradictions traceable to the seventh cause occurring in the
prophetical works require special investigation: and no one should
express his opinion on that matter by reasoning and arguing
without weighing the matter well in his mind.<BR>
Inconsistencies in the writings of true philosophers are traceable to
the fifth cause. Contradictions occurring in the writings of most
authors and commentators, such as are not included in the
above-mentioned works, are due to the sixth cause. Many
examples of this class of contradictions are found in the Midrash
and the Agada: hence the saying," We must not raise questions
concerning the contradictions met with in the Agada." You may
also notice in them contradictions due to the seventh cause. Any
inconsistency discovered in the present work will be found to arise
in consequence of the fifth cause or the seventh. Notice this,
consider its truth, and remember it well, lest you misunderstand
some of the chapters in this book.<BR>
Having concluded these introductory remarks I proceed to examine
those expressions, to the true meaning of which, as apparent from
the context, it is necessary to direct your attention. This book will
then be a key admitting to places the gates of which would
otherwise be closed. When the gates are opened and men enter,
their souls will enjoy repose, their eyes will be gratified, and even
their bodies, after all toil and labour, will be refreshed.
