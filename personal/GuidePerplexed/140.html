Ruab is a homonym, signifying" air," that is, one of the four
elements. Comp." And the air of God moved (Gen. i. 2).
It denotes also," wind." Comp. And the east wind (ruah) brought
the locusts" (Exod. x. 13):" west wind" (ruah) (ib. 19). In this
sense the word occurs frequently.
Next, it signifies" breath." Comp." A breath (ruah) that passeth
away, and does not come again" (PS. lxxviii. 39) wherein is the
breath (ruah) of life" (Gen. vii. 15).
It signifies also that which remains of mar after his death, and is
not subject to destruction. Comp." And the spirit (ruah) shall
return unto God who gave it" (Eccles. xii. 7).
Another signification of this word is" the divine inspiration of the
prophets whereby they prophesy" -as we shall explain, when
speaking on prophecy, as far as it is opportune to discuss this
subject in a treatise like this.Comp." And I will take of the spirit
(ruah) which is upon thee, and will put it upon them" (Num. xi.
17)" And it came to pass, when the spirit (ruah) rested upon them"
(ib. 25): The spirit (ruah) of the Lord spake by me (2 Sam. xxiii.
2). The term is frequently used in this sense.
The meaning of" intention ... .. will," is likewise contained in the
word ruah. Comp." A fool uttereth all his spirit" (ruah) (Prov.
xxix.11), i.e., his intention and will:" And the spirit (ruah) of
Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof, and I will destroy the counsel
thereof" (Isa. xix. 3), i.e., her intentions will be frustrated, and her
plans will be obscured;" Who has comprehended the spirit (ruah)
of the Lord, or who is familiar with his counsel that he may tell us
?" (Isa. xl. 13), i.e., Who knows the order fixed by His will, or
perceives the system of His Providence in the existing world, that
he may tell us ? as we shall explain in the chapters in which we
shall speak on Providence.
Thus the Hebrew ruah when used in reference to God, has
generally the fifth signification: sometimes, however, as explained
above, the last signification, viz.," will." The meaning of the word
in each individual case is therefore to be determined by the
context.
