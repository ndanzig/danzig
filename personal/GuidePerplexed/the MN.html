I.The Arabic Text.<BR>The editio princeps, the only edition of the
original text of the Guide (in Arabic, De1i1, or Dalalat a1-hatrin),
was undertaken and executed by the late S. Munk. Its title is: Le
Guide des Egaris, traite de Theologie et de Philosophic par Moite
ben Maimon, publie pour la premiere fois dans l'original Arabe, et
accompagne d'une traduction Francaise et di note: critiques,
litteraires et explicatives, par S. Munk (Paris, 1850-1866). The
plan was published, 1833, in Reflexions cur le culte des anciens
Hebreux (La Bible, par S. Cahen, vol. iv.), with a specimen of two
chapters of the Third Part. The text adopted has been selected from
the several MSS. at his disposal with great care and judgment.
Two Leyden MSS. (cod. 18 and 221), various MSS. of the
Bibliothique Nationale (No. 760, very old; 761 and 758, written by
R. Saadia Ibn Danan), and some MSS. of the Bodleian Library
were consulted. In the notes which accompany the French
translation, the various readings of the different MSS. are fully
discussed. At the end of the third volume a list is added of
"Variantes des Manuscrits Arabes et des deux Versions
HebraIques."<BR>
The library of the British Museum possesses two copies of the
Arabic text; the one Or. 5423 is complete, beautifully written, with
explanatory notes in the margin and between the lines. The name
of the copyist is not mentioned, nor the date when it has been
written. The volume has in the beginning an incomplete index to
the Scriptural passages referred to in the Guide, and at the end
fragments of Psalm cxli. in Arabic and of astronomical tables.
The second copy of the Dalalat al-halirin is contained in the MS.
Or. 2423, written in large Yemen Rabbinic characters. It is very
fragmentary. The first fragment begins with the last paragraph of
the introduction; there are a few marginal notes in Hebrew. In the
Bodleian Library there are the following copies of the Dalalat
alhalirin according to the Catal, of Hebr. MSS. by Dr. A.
Neubauer:--<BR>
No. 1236. The text is preceded by Jehudah al-Charizi's index of the
contents of the chapters, and by an index of Biblical quotstions. In
the margin there are notes, containing omissions, by different
hands, two in Arabic characters. The volume was written 1473.
No. 1237. The Arabic text, with a few marginal notes containing
various readings the text is preceded by three Hebrew poems,
beginning, De'i holek, Bi-sedeh tebunot; and Binu be-dat Mosheh.
Fol. 212 contains a fragment of the book (III., xxix.).
No. 1238. Text with a few marginal notes.<BR>
No. 1239. The end of the work is wanting in this copy. The second
part has forty-nine chapters, as the introduction to Part II. is
counted as chapter i.; Part III. has fifty-six chapters, the
introduction being counted as chapter i., and chapter xxiv. being
divided into two chapters. The index of passages from the
Pentatcuch follows the ordinary mode of counting the chapters of
the Guide.<BR>
No. 1240. Arabic text transcribed in Arabic characters by Saadiah
b. Levi Azankot for Prof. Golius in 1645.<BR>
No. 1245. First part of the Datalas al-hairis, written by Saadiah b.
Mordecai b. Mosheh in the year 1431.<BR>
No. 1242 contains the same Part, but incomplete. Nos. 1243, 1244,
1245, and 1246 contain Part II. of the Arabic text, incomplete in
No,. 1245 and 1246.<BR>
Nos. 1247, 1248, and 1249 have Part III.; it is incomplete in Nos.
1248 and 1249. No. 1249 was written 1291, and begins with III,
viii. A fragment of the Arabic text, the end of Part III., is contained
in No. 407, 2.<BR>
No. 2508 includes s fragment of the original (I. ii.-xxxii.), with a
Hebrew interlinrary translation of some words and a few marginal
notes. It is written in Yemen square characters, and is marked as
"holy property of the Synagogue of Alsiani."<BR>
A fragment (I. i.) of a different recension from the printed is
contained in 2422, 16. On the margin the Commentaries of
Shein-tob and Ephodi are added in Arabic.<BR>
A copy of the Datalat is also contained in the Berlin Royal Library
MS. Or. Qu., 579 (so; Cat. Steinschneider) ; it is defective in the
beginning and at the end.<BR>
The Cairo Genizah at Cambridge contains two fragments (a) I.lxiv.
and beginning of lxv ; (b) II. end of xxxii. and xxxiii. According to
Dr. H. Hirschfeld, Jewish Quarterly Review (vol. xv. p. 677), they
are in the handwriting of Maimonides.<BR>
The valuable collection of MSS. in the possession of Dr. M. Gaster
includes a fragment of the Dalalat-al-hairin (Codcx 6o5). II.
xiii--xv., beginning and end defective.<BR>
II. Translations, a. Hebrew.--As soon as European Jews heard of
the existence of this work, they procured its translation into
Hebrew. Two scholars, independently of each other, undertook the
task: Samuel Ibn Tibbon and Jehudah al-Harizi. There is, besides,
in the Moreh ha-moreh of Shemtob Paiquera an original
translation of some portions of the Moreh. In the Sifte yeshenim
(No. 112) a rhymed translation of the Dalalat by Rabbi Mattityahu
Kartin is mentioned. Ibn Tibbon s version is very accurate; he
sacrificed elegance of style to the desire of conscientiously
reproducing the author's work, and did not even neglect a particle,
however unimportant it may appear. Ibn Tibbon went in his
anxiety to retain peculiarities of the original so far as to imitate its
ambiguities, e.g., meziut (I. lviii.) is treated as a masculine noun,
only in order to leave it doubtful whether a pronoun which follows
agrees with meziut, "existence," or with nimza, "existing being,"
both occurring in the same sentence (Br. Mus. MS. Harl. 7586,
marg. note by Ibn Tibbon). When he met with passages that
offered any difficulty he consulted Maimonides. Harizi, on the
other hand, was less conscientious aboot words and particles, but
wrote in a superior style. Vox populi, however, decided in favour
of the version of Ibn Tibbon, the rival of which became almost
forgotten. Also Abraham, the son of Moses Maimooides, in
Milbamoth ha-shem, describes Harizi's version as being
inaccurate. Most of the modern translations were made from Ibn
Tibbon's version. There are, therefore, MSS. of this version almost
in every library containing collections of Hebrew books and MSS.
It has the title Moreh-nebuchim. The British Museum has the
following eight copies of Ibn Tibbon's version.:--<BR>
Harl. 7586 A. This codex was written in tlse year 1284, for Rabbi
Shabbatai ben Rabbi Mattityshu. In the year 1340 it came into the
possession of Jacob b. Shelomoh; his son Menabem sold it in the
year 1378 to R. Mattityaho, son of R. Shabbatai, for fifty gold
florins. It was again sold in the year 1461 by Yehiel ben Joab.
There is, this peculiarity in the writing, that long words at the end
of a line are divided, and written half on the one line, half on the
next ; in words which are vocalized, patah is frequently found for
kamez. There are numerous various readings in the margin. The
text is preceded by a poem, written by Joseph Ibn Aknin, pupil of
Maimonides, in praise of his master, and beginning Adon yizro.
This poem is attributed to R. Yehudah ha-Levi (Luzzatto, in his
Divan, Betulat-bat-Yehudah, p. 104). At the end the copyist adds
an epigram, the translation of which is as follows:--
"The Moreh is finished--Praise to Him who formed and created
everything--written for the instruction and benefit of the few
whom the Lord calleth. Those who oppose the Moreh ought to be
put to death ; but those who study and understand it deserve that
Divine Glory rest upon them, and inspire them with a spirit from
above."<BR>
Harl. 7586 B. This codex, much damaged in the beginning and at
the end, contains the version of Ibn Tibbon, with marginal notes,
consisting of words omitted in the text, and other corrections. The
version is followed by the poems Karob meod, etc., and De'i bolek,
etc.<BR>
Harl. 5507 contains the Hebrew version of Ibn Tibbon, with the
translator's preface and marginal notes, consisting of various
readings and omissions from the text. The work of Maimonides is
followed by Ibn Tibbon's Vocabulary (millot-zarot),
Mesharet-masheb, 'Arugot ba-mezimmab, Millot biggayon,
Ruah-hen, Alfarabi's Hatbalor, a Hebrew-Italian vocabulary of
logical terms, and an explanation of koreh. The passage in Part I.,
chap. lxxi., which refers to Christianity, has been erased.
Harl. 5525 was the property of Shimshon Kohen Modon. The MS.
begins with Harizi's Kavvanat ha-perakim ; then follows the text,
with a few marginal notes of a later hand, mostly adverse
criticisms and references to 'Arama's 'Akedab and the Biblical
commentaries of Abarbanel. There is also a note in Latin. The text
is followed by Ibn Tibbon's Vocabulary (Millor-zarot) and Masoret
ba-pesukim (Index to the Biblical quotations in the Moreh). In a
poem, beginning Moreh asben mennu derakav gabehu, the Moreh's
compared to a musical instrument, which delights when played by
one that understands music, but is spoiled when touched by an
ignorant person.<BR>
Add. 27068 (Almanzi coil.). At the end the following remark is
added : I, Samuel Ibn Tibbon, finished the translation of this work
in the month of Tebet 4965 (1205). The text is preceded by the
well-known epigrams, De'i bolek and Moreh -- nebuchim sa
shelomi; the last page contains the epigram Karob meod. There are
some notes in the margin, mostly referring to various readings.
Add. 14763. This codex, written 1273 at Viterbo, contains the
preface of Harizi to isis translation of the Moreh and his index of
contents, Ibn Tibbon's version with a few marginal notes of
different hands, including some remarks of the translator, and the
contents of the chapters. The codex contains besides the following
treatises: Commentary of Maimonides on Abot ; Comm. of Maini.
on Mishnah Sanhedrin x. i ; Letter of Maimonides on the
Resurrection of the Dead ; Vocabulary of difficult words by
Samuel Ibn Tibbon ; Maimonides' Letter to the wise men ot
Marseilles ; his Letter to Rabbi Jonathan ; Keter-malkut,
Mesbaret-mosheh, Ruah-hen, Otot ha-shamayim, translated from
the Arabic by Samuel Ibn Tibbon ; Hathalot ha-nimzaot, of
Alfarabi; Sefer ha-happuah, Mishle hamisbim ha-talmidim ; on the
seven zones of the earth ; a fragment of a chronicle from the exile
of Babylon down to the fourth year of the Emperor Nicepheros of
Constantinople, and a poem, which begins asher yishal, and has
the following sense:-- " If one asks the old and experienced for
advice, you may expect his success in all he undertakes but if one
consults the young, remember the fate of Rehoboam, son of
Solomon."<BR>
Add. 4764. In addition to the Hebrew version of Ibn Tibbon (from
end of I. xxvii.) with a few marginal notes and index, the codex
contains at the end of Part I. an Index of references made by the
author to explanations given in preceding or succeeding chapters.
At the end of the text the statement is added, that the translation
was finished in the month of Tebet 968 (1208). The Moreh is
followed by Ruah-hen, and Ibn Tibbon's Vocabulary of
millot-zarot (incomplete), and is preceded by four poems in praise
of the Moreh, beginning Shim'u nebone leb, Moreh nebucbim sa
shelomi, De'il bolek and Nofet mahkim.<BR>
Bibl. Reg. 16 A, xi. This codex, written in Prov. curs, characters in
the year 308, has in front a fragment of iii. i., then follows the
poem of Meshullam, beginning Yehgs mezimmotai (Gratz Leket --
shoshannim, p. 1511), and other poems.<BR>
The following MS. copies of Ibn Tibbon's version are included in
the Oxford Bodleian Library; the numbers refer to Dr. Neubauer's
catalogue of the MSS. :--<BR>
1250. An index of the passages from the Bible referred to in the
work, and an index of the contents precede the version. The
marginal note, contain chiefly omissions.<BR>
1251. This codex was written in 1675. The marginal notes contain
omissions and explanations.<BR>
1252. The marginal notes contain the translator's remarks on I.
lxxiv. 4, and III. xlvii. The version is followed by Ibn Tibbon a
vocabulary, and his additional remarks on the reasons for the
commandments. The MS. was bought by Samuel ben Moses from
a Christian after the pillage of Padua, where it had belonged to a
Synagogue of foreigners (lo' azim) ; he gave it to a Synagogue of
the same character at Mantua.<BR>
1253. The marginal notes include that of the translator on III. xlvii.

Fragments of the Version are contained in the following codices:
2047,3, p.65; 2283, 8; 2309, 2, and 2336.<BR>
Among the MS. copies of the Moreh in the Bibl. Nat. in Paris,
there is one that has been the property of R. Eliah Mizrahi, and
another that had been in the hands of Azariah de Rossi (No. 685
and No. 69!); the Gunzburg Library (Paris) possesses a copy (No.
775), that was written 1452 by Samuel son of Isaac for Rabbi
Moses de Leon, and Eliah del Medigo's copy of the Moreh is in the
possession of Dr. Ginsburg (London); it contains six poems,
beginning Moreh nebucbim sa; Emet marcb emet; Bi-lesbon esb;
Mabba'aru; Kamu more shav.<BR>
The editio princeps of this version has no statement as to where
and when it was printed, and is without pagination. According to
Furst (Bibliogr.) it is printed before 1480. The copy in the British
Museum has some MS. notes. Subsequent editions contain besides
the Hebrew text the Commentaries of Shem-tob and Efodi, and the
index of contents by Harizi (Venice, 1551, fol.) ; also the Comm.
of Crescas and Vocabulary of Ibn Tibbon (Sabionetta, 1553, fol. ;
Jessnitz, 1742, fol. etc.) ; the Commentaries of Narboni and S.
Mairnon (Berlin, 1791) ; the commentaries of Efodi, Shem-tob,
Crescas and Abarbanel (Warsaw, 1872, 4to); German translation
and Hebrew Commentary (Biur) Part I. (Krotoschin, 1839, 8vo);
German translation and notes, Part II. (Wien. 1864), Part III.
(Frankfort-a-M., 1838).<BR>
The Hebrew version of Ibn Tibbon (Part I. to ch. lxxii.) has been
translated into Mishnaic Hebrew by M. Levin (Zolkiew, 1829,
4to).<BR>
There is only one MS. known of Harizi's version, viz., No. 682 of
the Bibliothbque Nationale at Paris. It has been edited by L.
Schlosberg, with notes. London, 1851 (Part I.), 1876 (II.), and
1879 (III.). The notes on Part I. were supplied by S. Scheyer.
The first Latin translation of the Moreh has been discovered by Dr.
J. Perles among the Latin MSS. of the Munic Library, Catal. Cod.
latinorum bibl. regiae Monacensis, tom. i, pars iii. pag. 208 (Kaish.
36 b), 1700 (7936 b). This version is almost identical with that
edited by Augustinus Justinianus, Paris, 1520, and is based on
Harizi's Hebrew version of the Moreh. The name of the translator
is not mentioned. In the Commentary of Moses, son of Solomon,
of Salerno, on the Moreh, a Latin translation is quoted, and the
quotations agree with this version. It is called by this commentator
ha 'atakat ha-nozrit ("the Christian translation"), and its author,
ha-ma 'atik ha-nozer (lit. "the Christian translator"). Dr. Perles is,
however, of opinion that these terms do not necessarily imply that
a Christian has made this translation, as the word nozer may have
been used here for "Latin." He thinks that it is the result of the
combined efforts of Jewish and Christian scholars connected with
the court of the German Emperor Frederic II., especially as in the
thirteenth century several Jewish scholars distinguished
themselves by translating Oriental works into Latin. See Gratz
Monatschrift, 1875, Jan.-June, "Die in einer Munchener
Handschrift aufgefundene erste lateinische Uebersetzung," etc.,
von Dr. J. Perles. The title has been variously rendered into Latin:
Director neutrorum, directorium dubitantium, director neutrorum,
nutantium or dubitantium; doctor perplexorum.<BR>
Gedaliah ibn Yahyah, in Shalshelet ba-kabbalah, mentions a Latin
translation of the Moreh by Jacob Monteno: but nothing is known
of it, unless it be the anonymous translation of the Munich MS.,
mentioned above. Augustinus Justinianus edited this version
(Paris, 1520), with slight alterations and a great number of
mistakes. Joseph Scaliger's opinion of this version is expressed in a
letter to Casaubonus, as follows : Qui latine vertit, Hebraica, non
Arabica, convertit, et quidem saepe hallucinatur, neque mentem
Authoris assequitur. Magna seges mendorum est in Latino. Praeter
illa quae ab inertia Interpretis peccata sunt accessit et inertia
Librariorum aut Typographorum, e.g., prophethae pro philosophiae
altitudo pro aptitudo; bonitatem pro brevitatem. (Buxtorf, Doctor
Perplexorum, Praef.)<BR>
Johannes Buxtorfius, Fil., translated the Hebrew version of Ibn
Tibbon into Latin (Basilem, 1629, 4to). In the Praeefatio ad
Lectorem, the translator discusses the life and the works of
Maimonides, and dwells especially on the merits and the fate of
the Moreh-nebucbim. The preface is followed by a Hebrew poem
of Rabbi Raphael Joseph of Treves, in praise of an edition of the
Moreh containing the Commentaries of Efodi, Shem-tob, and
Crescas.<BR>
Italian was the first living language into which the Moreh has been
translated. This translation was made by Yedidyah ben Moses
(Amadeo de Molse di Recanati), and dedicated by him to
"divotissimo e divinissimo Signor mio il Signor Immanuel da
Fano" (i.e., the Kabbalist Menahem Azarriah). The translator
dictated it to his brother Eliah, who wrote it in Hebrew characters ;
it was finished the 8th of February, 1583. The MS. copy is
contained in the Royal Library at Berlin, MS. Or. Qu. 487 (M.
Steinschneider Catal., etc.)--The Moreh has been translated into
Italian a second time, and annotated by D. J. Maroni: Guida degli
Smarriti, Firenze, 1870, fol.<BR>
The Moreh has been translated into German by R. Furstenthal
(Part I,, Krotoschin, 1839), M. Stern (Part II., Wien, 1864), and S.
Scheyer (Part III.. Frankfort-a.-M., 1838). The translation is based
on Ibn Tibbon's Hebrew version. The chapters on the Divine
Attributes have been translated into German, and fully discussed,
by Dr. Kaufmann in his Geschichte der Attributenlehre (Gotha,
1877).<BR>
An excellent French translation, based on the Arabic original, has
been supplied by the regenerator of the Guide, S. Munk. It was
published together with the Arabic text (Paris, 1850-1866).
The Moreh has also been translated into the Hungarian language
by Dr. Klein. The translation is accompanied by notes (Budapest,
1878-80).<BR>
The portion containing the reasons of the Commandments (Part
III. ch. xxvi.--xlix.) has been translated into English by James
Townley (London, 1827). The translation is preceded by an
account on the life and works of Maimonides, and dissertations on
various subjects ; among others, Talmudical and Rabbinical
writings, the Originality of the Institutions of Moses, and Judicial
astrology.<BR>
III. Commentaries.--It is but natural that in a philosophical work
like the Moreh, the reader will meet with passages that at first
thought seem unintelligible, and require further explanation, and
this want has been supplied by the numerous commentators that
devoted their attention to the study of the Moreh. Joseph Solomon
del Medigo (1597) saw eighteen Commentaries. The four principal
ones he characterizes thus (in imitation of the Hagadah for
Passover) : Moses Narboni is rasha', has no piety, and reveals all
the secrets of the Moreh. Shem-tob is hakam, wise," expounds and
criticises ; Crescas is tam, "simple," explains the book in the style
of the Rabbis; Epodi is sbe-eno yode'a lisbol, " does not understand
to ask," he simply explains in short notes without criticism
Miktababuz; ed. A. Geiger, Berlin, 1840, p. i8). The earliest
annotations were made by the author himself on those passages,
which the first translator of the Moreh was unable to comprehend.
They are contained in a letter addressed to Samuel Ibn Tibbon,
beginning, lefi siklo ycbuilal isb (Bodl Library, No. 2218, s. ;
comp. The Guide, etc., I. 21, 343 ; II. 8, 99). Ibn Tibbon, the
translator, likewise added a few notes, which are found in the
margin of MSS. of the Hebrew version of the Moreh (on I. xlv.
lxxiv. ; II. xxiv. ; and III. xlvii.--MSS. BodI. 1252, 1; 1253, 1255,
1257; Brit. Mus. Add. 14,763 and 27,068).<BR>
Both translators wrote explanations of the philosophical terms
employed in the versions. Harizi wrote his vocabulary first, and
Ibn Tibbon, in the introductory remarks, to Perush millot zarot
("Explanation of difficult words"), describes his rival's vocabulary
as full of blunders. Ibn Tibbon's Perush is found almost in every
copy of his version, both MS. and print; so also Harizi's index of
the contents of the chapters of the Moreh (Kavvanat ha-perakim).
The following is an alphabetical list of Commentaries on the
Moreh :--<BR>
Abarbanel (Don Isaak) wrote a Commentary on I. i.--lv.; II.
xxxi.--xlv., and a separate book Shamayim-badasbim, "New
Heavens," on II. xix., in which he fully discusses the question
concerning Creatio ex nibilo. The opinion of Maimonides is not
always accepted. Thus twenty-seven objections are raised against
his interpretation of the first chapter of Ezekiel. These objections
he wrote at Molin, in the house of R. Abraham Treves Zarfati. The
Commentary is followed by a short essay (maamar) on the plan of
the Moreh. The method adopted by Abarbanel in all his
Commentaries, is also employed in this essay. A series of
questions is put forth on the subject, and then the author sets about
to answer them. M. J. Landau edited the Commentary without text,
with a Preface, and with explanatory notes, called Moreh
li-zealdakah (Prag. 1831; MS. BodI. 2385). In addition to these the
same author wrote Tesbubat " Answers" to several questions asked
by Rabbi Shsol ha-Cohen on topics discussed in the Moreh
(Venice, 1754).<BR>
Abraham Abulajia wrote "Sodot ha-moreh," or Sitre-torah, a
kabbalistic Commentary on the Moreh. He gives the expreaaion,
[hebrew] (Paradise), for the number (177) of the chapters of the
Moreh. MS. Nat. Bibi. 226, 3. Leipsic Libr. 232,4. MS. Bodl. 2360,
contains a portion of Part III.<BR>
Buchner A. Ha-march li-zedakab (Warsaw, 1838). Commentary on
"The Reasons of the Laws," March III. xxix.--xlix. The
Commentary is preceded by an account of the life of Maimonides.
Comtino, Mordecai b. Eliezer, wrote a shart commentary on the
Moreh (Dr. Ginsburg's collection of MSS. No. 1o). Narboni, who
"spread light on dark passages in the Guide," is frequently quoted.
Reference is also made to his own commentary on Ibn Ezra's
Yesod--mara.<BR>
Creacas (Aaher b. Abraham), expresses in the Preface to his
Commentary the conviction that he could not always comprehend
the right sense of the words of Maimonides, for "there is no
searching to his underatanding." He nevertheless thinks that his,
explanations will help "the young" to study the Moreh with profit.
A long poem in praise of Maimonides and his work precedes the
Preface. His notes are short and clear, and in spite of his great
respect of Maimonides, he now and then criticises and corrects
him.<BR>
David Yailya is named by Joseph Del Medigo (Miktab-abaz ed. A.
Geiger, Berlin, 1840; p. 18 , and note 76), as having written a
Commentary on the Moreh.<BR>
David ben Yebudab Leon Rabbins wrote 'En ba-kore, MS. Bodl.
1263. He quotes in his Commentary among others 'Arama's
'Akedar yizhak. The Preface is written by Immanuel ben Raphael
Ibn Meir, after the death of the author.<BR>
Efadi is the name of the Commentary written by Isaac ben Moses,
who during the persecution of 1391 had passed as Christian under
the name of Profiat Doran. He returned to Judaism, and wrote
against Christianity the famous satire " Al tehee kaaboteka" ("Be
not like your Fathers"), which misled Christizns to cite it as written
in favour of Christianity. It is addressed to the apostate En Bonet
Bon Giorno. The same author also wrote a grammatical work, Ma'
aseb-efod. The name Efod (Hebrew), is explained as composed of
the initials Amar Profiat Duran. His Commentary consists of short
notes, esplanatory of the text. The brginning of this Commentary is
contained in an Arabic translation in MS. Bodl. 2422, 16.
Epbraim Al-Naqavab in Sba'or Kebad ba-sbem (MS. BodI. 939,2
and 1258,2), answers some questions addressed to him concerning
the Moreh. He quotes Hiadai's Or adonai.<BR>
Furstentbal, R., translator and commentator of the Mahzor, added
a Biur, short explanatory notes, to his German translation of Part I.
of the Morch (Krotoschin, 1839).<BR>
Gerahan, Mareb-derek, Commentary on Part 1. of the Moreh (MS.
BodI. 1265).<BR>
Hillel b. Samuel b. Elazar of Verona explained the Introduction to
Part II, (the 25 Propos.). S. H. Halberstam edited this Commentary
together with Tagmute ha-nefemh of the same author, for the
Society Mekize-nirdamim (Lyck, 1874).<BR>
Joseph ben Aba-mart b. Josepb, of Caspi (Argentiere), wrote three
Commentaries on the Moreh. The first is contained in a Munich
MS. (No. 263) ; and seems to have been recast by the author, and
divided into two separate Commentaries: 'Ammude Kesef, and
Maskiyot Keatf The former was to contain plain and ordinary
explanation, whilst profound and mysterious matter was reserved
for the second (Steinschn. Cat.). In II., chap. xlviii., Caspi finds
fault with Maimonides that he dues not place the book of Job
among the highest class of inspired writings, "its author being
undoubtedly Moses." These Commentaries have been edited by T.
Werblomer (Frankfort-a.-M., 1848). R. Kirchheim added a Hebrew
introduction discussing the character of these commentaries, and
describing the manuscripts from which these were copied ; a
Biography of the author is added in German.<BR>
Josepb Giqatilia wrote notes on the Moreh, printed with
"Questinnn of Shaul ha-kohen" (Venice, 1574. MS. Bodl.. 1911,
3).<BR>
Josepb b. Isaac ha-Levi's Gib'ar ha-Moreh is a short Commentary
on portions of the Moreh, with notes by R. Yom-tub Heller, the
author of Tosafar ram-sob (Prag., 1612).<BR>
Isaac Saranov wrote a commentary on Parts II. and IIII. of the
Moreb (see Maimon Solomon p. xxi.).<BR>
Isaac ben Shem-tob ibn Shem-tob wrote a lengthy Commentary on
the Moreh, Part I. (MS. Brit. Mus, Or. 1358). The object of the
Commentary is to show that there is no contradiction between
Maimonides and the Divine Law. He praises Maimonides as a true
believer in Creatio ex nihilo, whilst Ibn Ezra and Gersonides
assumed a prima materia, (Yozer, kadosb). Nachmanides is called
ha-hasid ha-gadol, but is nevertheless blamed, together with
Narboni and Zerahyals ba-Levi, for criticising Maimonides,
instead of trying to explain startling utterances even in "a forced
way" (bederek rabok) and Narboni, "in spite of his wisdom,
frequently misunderstood the Moreh." At the end of each chapter a
resume‚ (derush) of the contents of the chapter is given, and the
lesson to be derived from it. The MS. is incomplete, chaps.
xlvi.--xlviii. are missing.<BR>
Kauffmann, D, in his Geschichte der Atributenlebre, translated
Part I. chap. L--lxiii. into German, and added critical and
explanatory notes.
Kalonymos wrote a kind of introduction to the Moreh (Mesbaret
Masbeb), in which he especially discusses the theory of
Maimonides on Providence.<BR>
Leibnitz made extracts from Buxtorf's. Latin version of the Moreb,
and added his own remarks, Observationes ad R. Mosen
Maimoniden (Foucher de Careil, CA., La Philos opbie
Fuive,1861).<BR>
Levin, M, wrote Allon-moreb as a kind of introduction to his
retranslation of Tibbon's Hebrew version into the language of the
Mishnah.<BR>
Maimon, Solomon, is the author of Gib' ha-moreb, a lengthy
commentary on Book I. (Berlin, 1791). The author is fond of
expatiating on topics of modern philosophy, to the introduction he
gives a short history of philosophy. The commentary on Books II.
and III. was written by Isaac Satanov.<BR>
Meir ben Jonah ha-mekunneb Ben-ibneor wrote a commentary on
the Moreh in Fez 1560 (MS. Bodl. 1262).<BR>
Menahem Kara expounded the twenty-five propositions
enumerated in the Introduction to Part II. of the Moreh (MS. BodI.
1649, 13).<BR>
Mordecai Yaffe, in his Or Yekarot or Pinnat Yikrat, one of his ten
Lebushim, comments upon the theories contained in the Moreh.
Moses, son of Abraham Provencal, explains the passage in Part I.
chap. lxxiii. Prop. 3, in which Maimonides refers to the difference
between commensurable and incommensurable lines (MS. Bodl..
2033, 8).<BR>
Moses, son of Febudab Nagari, made an index of the subjects
treated 1n the Moreh, indicating in each case the chapters in which
allusion is made to the subject. He did so, "in obedience to the
advice of Maimonides, to consider the chapters in connected
order" (Part I. p. 20). It has been printed together with the
questions of Shaul ha-kohen (Venice, 1574).<BR>
Moses son of Solomon of Salerno, is one of the earliest
expounders of the Moreh. He wrote his commentary on Parts I. and
II., perhaps together with a Christian scholar. He quotes the
opinion of "the Christian scholar with whom he worked together."
Thus he names Petrus de Bernia and Nicolo di Giovenazzo. R.
Jacob Anatoli, author of the Malmed ha-talmidim, is quoted as
offering an explanation for the passage from Pirke di-rabbi Eliezer,
which Mamnonides (II. chap. xxvi.) considers as strange and
inexplicable (Part I., written 1439 ; MS. of Bet ha-midrash,
London; Parts I.--II., MS. Bodl, 1261, written, 1547; MS.
Petersburg, No. 82; Munich MS. 60 and 370).<BR>
Moses ha-kotan, son of Jebudab, son of Moses, wrote To'aliyoz
pirke ha-maamar ("Lessons taught in the chapters of this work"). It
is an index to the March (MS. Bodl. 1267).<BR>
Moses Leiden explained the 25 Prop. of the Introduction to Part II.
(MS. Gunzburg, Paris).<BR>
Moses Narboni wrote a short commentary at Soria 1362. He freely
criticizes Maimonides, and uses expressions like the following:--
"He went too far, may God pardon him" (II. viii.). Is. Euchel ed.
Part I. (Berlin, 1791); J. Goldenthal, I. to III. (Wien, 1852). The
Bodl. Libr. possesses several MS. copies of this commentary (Nos.
1260, 1264, 2, and 1266).<BR>
Munk, S., added to his French translation of the Moreh numerous
critical and explanatory notes.<BR>
S.Sacb's (Ha-tehiyah, Berlin, 1850, p. 5) explains various passages
of the Moreb, with a view of discovering the names of those who
are attacked by Maimonides without being named.<BR>
Scheyer, S., added critical and explanatory notes to his German
translation of the Moreh, Part 3, and to the Hebrew version of
Harizi, Part I. He also wrote Das Psychologiscbe System des
Maimonides, an Introduction to the Moreh (Frankf.-a-M., 1845).
Shem tab Ibn Palquera's Moreb ba-moreh consists of 3 parts :(1) a
philosophical explanation of the Moreb, (2) a description of the
contents of the chapters of the Moreb, Part I, i.--lvii. (Presburg,
1827) ; (3) Corrections of Ibn Tibbon's version. He wrote the book
for himself, that in old age he might have a means of refreshing his
memory. The study of science and philosophy is to be
recommended, but only to those who have had a good training in
"the fear of sin." Ibn Roshd (Averroes) is frequently quoted, and
referred to as be-hakam ha-nizkar (the philosopher mentioned
above).<BR>
Sbem-tob ben Joseph ben Sbem-tob had the commentary of Efodi
before him, which he seems to have quoted frequently verbatim
without naming him. In the preface he dwells on the merits of the
Moreb as the just mediator between religion and philosophy. The
commentary of Shem-tobh is profuse, and includes almost a
paraphrase of the text. He apologises in conclusion for having
written many superfluous notes and added explanation where no
explanation was required ; his excuse is that he did not only intend
to write a commentary (biur) but also a work complete in itself
(hibbur). He often calls the reader's attention to things which are
plain and clear.<BR>
Shem-tob Ibn Shem-tob, in Sefer ba-emunot (Ferrara, 1556),
criticises some of the various theories discussed in the Moreh, and
rejects them as heretic. His objections were examined by Moses
Al-ashkar, and answered in Hasagot 'al mab sbe-katab Rabbi
Sbem-tab neged ha-Rasnbam (Ferrara, 1556).<BR>
Salomon b. Febudab ha-nasi wrote in Germany Sitre-torah, a
kabbalistic commentary on the Moreb, and dedicated it to his pupil
Jacob b. Samuel (MS. Bet-ha-midrash, London).<BR>
Tabrizi. The twenty-five Propositions forming the introduction to
Part 2, have been fully explained by Mohammed Abu-becr ben
Mohammed al-tabrizi. His Arabic explanations have been
translated by Isaac b. Nathan of Majorca into Hebrew (Ferraro,
1556). At the end the following eulogy is added :--The author of
these Propositions is the chief whose sceptre is "wisdom" and
whose throne is "understanding," the Israelite prince, that has
benefited his nation and all those who love God, etc. Moses b.
Maimon b. Ebed-elohim, the Israelite. . . . May God lead us to the
truth. Amen !<BR>
Tishbi. In MS. Bodl. 2279, I, there are some marginal notes on
Part III. which are signed Tishbi (Neub. Cat.).<BR>
Yahya Ibn Suleiman wrote in Arabic a Commentary on the Guide
of the Perplexed. A fragment is contained in the Berlin MS. Or.
Qu., 554, 2 (Steinschneider, Cat. No. 92).<BR>
Zerahyab is. Isaac ha-Levi. Commentary on the Moreh, I., i.--lxxi.,
and some other portions of the work. (See Maskir, 1861, p. 125).
MS. Bodl. 2360, 8, contains a letter of Jehudah b. Shelomoh on
some passages of the Moreb, and Zerahyah's reply.<BR>
Anonymous Commentaries.--The MS. Brit. Mus. 1423 contains
marginal and interlineary notes in Arabic. No author or date is
given, nor is any other commentary referred to in the notes. The
explanations given are mostly preceded by a question, and
introduced by the phrase, "the answer is," in the same style as is
employed in the Hebrew-Arabic Midrash, MS. Brit. Mus. Or.
2213. The Midrashic character is prominent in the notes. Thus the
verse "Open, ye gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the
truth may enter in," is explained as meaning: Open, ye gates of
wisdom, that human understanding that perceiveth truth may enter.
The notes are numerous, especially in the first part, explaining
almost every word; e.g., on "Rabbi": Why does Maimonides
employ this title before the name of his pupil The answer is: either
the word is not to be taken literally master"), but as a mere
compliment, or it has been added by later copyisIs. Of a similar
style seem to be the Arabic notes in the Berlin MS. Or. Oct. 258, 2,
8, so. (Cat. Steinschneider, No. 108.)--Anonymous marginal notes
are met with almost in every MS. of the Moreh; e.g., Brit. Mos.
Harl. 5525 ; Add. 14,763, 14,764; Bodl. 1264, I ; 2282, 10; 2423, 3
; Munich MS., 239, 6.<BR>
The explanation of passages from the Pentateuch contained in the
Moreh have been collected by D. Ottensoaaer, and given as an
appendix (Morehderek) to Derek -sclulah (Pent. with Comm. etc.,
Furth, 1824).<BR>
IV. Controvercies.--The seemingly new ideas put forth by
Maimonides in the Moreb and in the first section of his
Mishneh-torah (Sefer ha-madda) soon produced a lively
controversy as regards the merits of Maimonides theories. It was
most perplexing to pious Talmudists to learn how Maimonides
explained the anthropomorphisms employed in the Bible, the
Midrashim and the Talmud, what he thought about the future state
of our soul, and that he considered the study of philosophy as the
highest degree of Divine worship, surpassing even the study of the
Law and the practice of its precepts. The objections and attacks of
Daniel of Damascus were easily silenced by a herem
(excommunication) pronounced against him by the Rosh ha-golah
Rabbi David. Stronger was the opposition that had its centre in
Montpellier. Rabbi Solomon ben Abraham noticed with regret in
his own community the fruit of the theories of Maimonides in the
neglect of the study of the Law and of the practice of the Divine
precepts. It happened to Moses Maimonides what in modern times
happened to Moses Mendelssohn. Many so-called disciples and
followers of the great master misunderstood or misinterpreted his
teaching in support of their dereliction of Jewish law and Jewish
practice, and thus brought disrepute on him in the eyes of their
opponents. Thus it came that Rabbi Solomon and his disciples
turned their wrath against the writings of Maimonides instead of
combating the arguments of the pseudo-Maimonists. The latter
even accused Solomon of having denounced the Moreh and the
Sefer ha-madda to the Dominicans, who condemned these writings
to the flames; when subsequently copies of the Talmud were burnt,
and some of the followers of the Rabbi of Montpellier were
subjected to cruel tortures, the Maimonists saw in this event a just
punishment for offending Maimonides. (Letters of Hillel of
Verona, Hemdab Genuzab, ed. H. Edelmann, p. 58 .sqq.).<BR>
Meir b. Todros ba-levi Abulafia wrote already during the lifetime
of Maimonides to the wise men in Lunel about the heretic
doctrines he discovered in the works of Maimonides. Ahron b.
Meshullam and Shesheth Benvenisti defended Maimonides. About
1232 a correspondence opened between the Maimonists and the
Anti-maimonists (Griitz, Gesch. d. J. vii. note I). The Grammarian
David Kimhi wrote in defence of Maimonides three letters to
Jehudah Alfachar, who answered each of them in the sense of
Rabbi Solomon of Montpellier. Abraham b. Hisdai and Samuel b.
Abraham Saportas on the side of the Maimonists, took part in the
controversy. Meshullam b. Kalonymos b. Todros of Narbonne
begged Alfachar to treat Kimhi with more consideration,
whereupon Alfachar resolved to withdraw from the controversy.
Nabmanides, though more on the side of Rabbi Solomon, wrote
two letters of a conciliatory character, advising moderation on
both sides. Representatives of the congregations of Saragossa,
Huesca, Monzon, Kalatajud, and Lends signed declarations against
R. Solomon. A herem was proclaimed from Lunel and Narbonne
against the Anti-Maimonists. The son of Maimonides, Abraham,
wrote a pamphlet Milbamot adonai, in defence of the writings of
his father. The controversy raised about fifty years later by Abba
Man Don Astruc and R. Solomon ben-Aderet of Barcelona,
concerned the Moreh less directly. The question was of a more
general character: Is the study of philosophy dangerous to the
religious belief of young students? The letters written in this
controversy are contained in Minbat-kenaot by Abba Mari Don
Astruc (Presburg, 1838), and Kitab alrasail of Meir Abulafia ed. J.
Brill (Paris, 1871). Yedaya Bedrasi took part in this controversy,
and wrote Ketab hitnazlut in defence of the study of philosophy
(Teshubot Rashba, Hanau, 1610, p. iii b.). The whole controversy
ended in the victory of the Moreh and the other writings of
Maimonides. Stray remarks are found in various works, some in
praise and some in condemnation of Maimonides. A few instances
may suffice. Rabbi Jacob Emden in his Mitpabat-sefarim
(Lemberg, 1870, p. 56) believes that parts of the Moreh are
spurious ; he even doubts whether any portion of it is the work of
"Maimonides, the author of the Mishneh-torah, who was not
capable of writing such heretic doctrines," S. D. Luzzato regards
Maimonides with great reverence, but this does not prevent him
from severely criticising his philosophical theories (Letters to S.
Rappoport, No. 79, 83, 266, Iggeroth Shedal ed. E. Graber, Premys
l, 1882), and from expressing his conviction that the saying "From
Moses to Moses none rose like Moses," was as untrue as that
suggested by Rappoport, "From Abraham to Abraham (Ibn-Ezra)
none rose like Abraham." Rabbi Hirsch Chayyuth in
Darke-Mosbeb (Zolkiew, 5840) examines the attacks made upon
the writings of Maimonides, and tries to refute them, and to show
that they can be reconciled with the teaching of the Talmud.
The Bodl. MS. 2240, 3a, contains a document signed by Josselman
and other Rabbis, declaring that they accept the teaching of
Maimonides as correct, with the exception of his theory about
angels and sacrifices.<BR>
Numerous poems were written, both in admiration and in
condemnation of the Moreh. Most of them precede or follow the
Moreb in the printed editions and in the various MS. copies of the
work. A few have been edited in Dibre-hakamim, pp. 75 and 86; in
the Literaturblatt d. Or. I. 379, II. 26-27, IV. 748, and
Leket-shoshannim by Dr. Gratz. In the Sammelband of the Mekize
Nirdamim (1885) a collection of 69 of these poems is contained,
edited and explained by Prof. Dr. A. Berliner. In imitation of the
Moreh and with a view of displacing Maimonides work, the
Karaite Ahron II. b. Eliah wrote a philosophical treatise,
Ez-bayyim (Ed. F. Delitzseh. Leipzig, 1841).<BR>
