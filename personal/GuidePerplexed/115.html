ALTHOUGH the two roots nazab and yazab are distinct, yet their
meaning is, as you know, identical in all their various forms.
The verb has several meanings: in some instances it signifies" to
stand or" to place oneself," as" And his sister stood (va-tetazzab)
afar off" (Exod. ii. 4):" The kings of the earth set themselves"
(yiyazzebu) (PS. ii. 2):" They came out and stood" (nizzabim)
(Num. xvi. 27). In other instances it denotes continuance and
permanence, as," Thy word is established (nizzab) in Heaven" (Ps.
cxix. 89), i.e., it remains for ever.
Whenever this term is applied to God it must be understood in the
latter sense, as," And, behold, the Lord stood (nizzab) upon it"
(Gen. xxviii. 13), i.e., appeared as eternal and everlasting" upon
it," namely, upon the ladder, the upper end of which reached to
heaven, while the lower end touched the earth. This ladder all may
climb up who wish to do so, and they must ultimately attain to a
knowledge of Him who is above the summit of the ladder, because
He remains upon it permanently. It must be well understood that
the term" upon it" is employed by me in harmony with this
metaphor." Angels of God" who were going up represent the
prophets. That the term" angel" was applied to prophets may
clearly be seen in the following passages:" He sent an angel"
(Num. xx. 16):" And an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to
Bochim" (judges ii.1). How suggestive, too, is the expression"
ascending and descending on it"! The ascent is mentioned before
the descent, inasmuch as the" ascending" and arriving at a certain
height of the ladder precedes the" descending," i.e., the
application of the knowledge acquired in the ascent for the training
and instruction of mankind. This application is termed" descent,"
in accordance with our explanation of the term yarad (chapter x.).
To return to our subject. The phrase" stood upon it" indicates the
permanence and constancy of God, and does not imply the idea of
physical position. This is also the sense of the phrase" Thou shalt
stand upon the rock" (Exod. xxxiii. 21). It is therefore clear that
nizzab and amad are identical in this figurative signification.
Comp." Behold, I will stand ('omed) before thee there upon the
rock in Horeb" (Exod. xvii. 6).
