Tnis chapter treats of the meaning of three terms which we find
necessary to explain, viz., hesed (" loving kindness" ), mishpat ("
judgment" ), and zedakah (" righteousness" ).
In our Commentary on the Sayings of the Fathers (chap. v. 7) we
have explained the expression hesed as denoting an excess [in
some moral quality]. It is especially used of extraordinary
kindness. Loving-kindness is practised in two ways: first, we show
kindness to those who have no claim whatever upon us; secondly,
we are kind to those to whom it is due, in a greater measure than is
due to them. In the inspired writings the term hesed occurs mostly
in the sense of showing kindness to those who have no claim to it
whatever. For this reason the term hesod is employed to express
the good bestowed upon us by God :" I will mention the
loving-kindness of the Lord" (Isa. lxiii. 7). On this account, the
very act of the creation is an act of God's loving-kindness." I have
said, The Universe is built up in loving-kindness" (Ps. lxxxix. 3):
i.e., the building up of the Universe is an act of loving-kindness.
Also, in the enumeration of God's attributes, Scripture says:" And
abundant in loving-kindness" (Exod. xxxiv. 6).
The term zedakah is derived from zedek," righteousness": it
denotes the act of giving every one his due, and of showing
kindness to every being according as it deserves. In Scripture,
however, the expression zedakah is not used in the first sense, and
does not apply to the payment of what we owe to others. When we
therefore give the hired labourer his wages, or pay a debt, we do
not perform an act of zedakah. But we do perform an act of
zedakah when we fulfil those duties towards our fellow-men which
our moral conscience imposes upon us: e.g., when we heal the
wound of the sufferer. Thus Scripture says, in reference to the
returning of the pledge [to the poor debtor]:" And it shall be
zedakah (righteousness) unto thee" (Deut. xxiv. 11). When we
walk in the way of virtue we act righteously towards our
intellectual faculty, and pay what is due unto it; and because every
virtue is thus zedakah, Scripture applies the term to the virtue of
faith in God. Comp." And he believed in the Lord, and he
accounted it to him as righteousness" (Gen. xv. 6):" And it shall
be our righteousness" (Dent. vi. 25).
The noun mishpat," judgment," denotes the act of deciding upon a
certain action in accordance with justice which may demand either
mercy or punishment.
We have thus shown that zesed denotes pure charity; zedakah
kindness, prompted by a certain moral conscience in man, and
being a means of attaining perfection for his soul, whilst mishpat
may in some cases find expression in revenge, in other cases in
mercy.
In discussing the impropriety of admitting attributes of God (Part
L, chap. liii., seq.), we stated that the divine attributes which occur
in Scripture are attributes of His actions; thus He is called hasid,"
kind," because He created the Universe; zaddik," righteous," on
account of His mercy with the weak, in providing for every living
being according to its powers; and shofet," judge," on account of
the relative good and the great relative evils that are decreed by
God's justice as directed by His wisdom. These three names occur
in the Pentateuch:" Shall not the judge (shofet) of all the earth,"
etc. (Gen. xviii. 25):" Righteous (Xaddik) and upright is he" (Dent.
xxxii. 4):" Abundant in loving-kindness" (hesed, Exod. xxxiv. 6).
We intended in explaining these three terms to prepare the reader
for the next chapter.
