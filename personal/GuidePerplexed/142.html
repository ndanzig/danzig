Hai (" living" ) signifies a sentient organism (lit." growing" and"
having sensation" ), comp." Every moving thing that liveth" (Gen.
ix. 3): it also denotes recovery from a severe illness :" And was
recovered (va-yehi) of his sickness" (Isa. xxxviii. 0' ): 11 In the
camp till they recovered" (hayotam) (josh. v. 8):" quick, raw (bat)
flesh" (Lev. xiii. 10).
Mavet signifies" death" and" severe illness," as in" His heart
died (va-yamot) within him, and he became as a stone" (I Sam.
xxv. 37), that is, his illness was severe. For this reason it is stated
concerning the son of the woman of Zarephath," And his sickness
was so sore, that there was no breath left in him" (I Kings xvii.
17). The simple expression va-yamoth would have given the idea
that he was very ill, near death, like Nabal when he heard what had
taken place.
Some of the Andalusian authors say that his breath was suspended,
so that no breathing could be perceived at all, as sometimes an
invalid is seized with a fainting fit or an attack of asphyxia, and it
cannot be discovered whether he is alive or dead: in this condition
the patient may remain a day or two.
The term hai has also been employed in reference to the
acquisition of wisdom. Comp." So shall they be life (hayyim) unto
thy soul" (Prov. iii. 22):" For whoso findeth me findeth life" (ib.
viii. 35):" For they are life (hayyim) to those that find them" (ib.
iv. 22). Such instances are numerous. In accordance with this
metaphor, true principles are called life, and corrupt principles
death. Thus the Almighty says," See, I have set before thee this
day life and good and death and evil" (Dent. xxx. 15), showing
that" life" and" good,"" death" and" evil," are identical, and
then He explains these terms. In the same way I understand His
words," That ye may live" (ib. v. 33), in accordance with the
traditional interpretation of" That it may be well with thee" [scil.
in the life to come] (ib. xxii. 7). In consequence of the frequent use
of this figure in our language our Sages said," The righteous even
in death are called living, while the wicked even in life are called
dead." (Talm. B. Berakkoth, P. 78). Note this well.
