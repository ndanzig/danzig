THE term male is a homonym which denotes that one substance
enters another, and fills it, as" And she filled (va-temalle) her
pitcher" (Gen. xxiv. 16):" An omer-full (melo) for each" (Exod.
xvi. 32), and many other instances. Next, it signifies the expiration
or completion of a fixed period of time, as" And when her days to
be delivered were fulfilled (va-yimleu)" (Gen. XXV. 24):" And
forty days were completed (va-yimleu) for him" (Gen. 1. It further
denotes attainment of the highest degree of excellency, as Full
(male) with the blessing of the Lord" (Dent. xxxiii. 23)
Them hath he filled (mille) with wisdom of heart" (Exod. xxxv.
35) He was filled (va-yimmale) with wisdom, and understanding,
and cunning" (I Kings vii. 14). In this sense it is said" The whole
earth is full (melo) of his glory" (Isa. vi. 4)," All the earth gives
evidence of his perfection," i.e. leads to a knowledge of it. Thus
also" The glory of the Lord filled (male) the tabernacle" (Exod.
xl. 34): and, in fact, every application of the word to God must be
interpreted in this manner; and not that He has a body occupying
space. If, on the other hand, you prefer to think that in this passage
by" the glory of the Lord," a certain light created for the purpose is
to be understood, that such light is always termed" glory," and that
such light" filled the tabernacle," we have no objection.
