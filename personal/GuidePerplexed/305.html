IT is necessary to notice that the plural marot elohim," visions of
God," is here used, and not the singular mareh," vision," for there
were several things, of different kinds, that were perceived by the
prophet. The following three things were perceived by him: the
Olannim, the Hayyot, and the man above the Hayyot. The
description of each of these visions is introduced by the word
va-ereh," and I beheld?' For the account of the Hayyot, begins,"
And I looked (va-ereh), and behold a whirlwind," etc. (Ezek. i. 4).
The account of the Ofannim begins :" Now as I beheld (va-ereh)
the Hayyot, behold one ofan upon the earth" (ver. 15). The vision
of that which is above the Hayyot in order and rank begins:" And I
saw (va-ereh) as the colour of the amber, etc., from the appearance
of his loins even upward" (ver. 27). The word va-ereh," and I
beheld," only occurs these three times in the description of the
Mercabah. The doctors of the Mishnah have already explained this
fact, and my attention was called to it by their remarks. For they
said that only the two first visions, namely, that of the Rayyot and
the Ofannim, might be interpreted to others; but of the third vision,
viz., that of the hashmal and all that is connected with it, only the
heads of the sections may be taught. Rabbi [Jehudah], the Holy, is
of opinion that all the three visions are called ma'aseh mercabah,
and nothing but the heads of the sections could be communicated
to others. The exact words of the discussion are as follows:--
Where does maaseh mereabhah end ? Rabbi says, with the last
va-ereh; Rabbi YizIiak says it ends at the word hashmal (ver. 27).
The portion from va-ereh to hashmal may be fully, taught; of that
which follows, only the heads of the sections; according to some it
is the passage from va-ereh to hashmal, of which the heads of the
sections may be taught, but that which follows may only be studied
by those who possess the capacity, whilst those that cannot study it
by themselves must leave it. -- It is clear from the words of our
Sages that different visions are described, as may also be inferred
from the repetition of the word va-ereh, and that these visions are
different from each other in degree: the last and highest of them is
the vision commencing," And I saw as the colour of hashmal" :
that is to say, the divided figure of the man, described as" the
appearance of fire, etc., from the appearance of his loins even
upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward,"
etc. There is a difference of opinion among our Sages whether it is
permitted to give by way of hints an exposition of any part of this
third vision, or whether it is prohibited even to teach of it the
heads of the sections, so that only the wise can arrive at
understanding it by their own studies. You will also notice a
difference of opinion among our Sages in reference to the two first
visions, viz., that of the Hayyot and that of the Olannim whether
these may be taught explicitly or only by way of hints, dark
sayings, and heads of sections. You must also notice the order of
these three visions. First comes the vision of the HaYyot, because
they are first in rank and in the causal relation, as it is said," For
the spirit of the Hayyah was in the Olannim," and also for other
reasons. The vision of the Ofannim [comes next, and] is followed
by one which is higher than the Hayyot, as has been shown. The
cause of this arrangement is, that in study the first two must
necessarily precede the third, and in fact they lead to it.
