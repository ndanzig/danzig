IT is one of the ancient beliefs, both among the philosophers and
other people, that the motions of the spheres produced mighty and
fearful sounds. They observed how little objects produced by rapid
motion a loud, shrilling, and terrifying noise, and concluded that
this must to a far higher degree be the case with the bodies of the
sun, the moon and the stars, considering their greatness and their
velocity. The Pythagoreans believed that the sounds were pleasant,
and, though loud, had the same proportions to each other as the
musical notes. They also explained why these mighty and
tremendous sounds are not heard by us. This belief is also
widespread in our nation. Thus our Sages describe the greatness of
the sound produced by the sun in the daily circuit in its orbit. The
same description could be given of all heavenly bodies. Aristotle,
however, rejects this, and holds that they produce no sounds. You
will find his opinion in the book The Heavens and the World (De
Coelo). You must not find it strange that Aristotle differs here
from the opinion of our Sages. The theory of the music of the
spheres is connected with the theory of the motion of the stars in a
fixed sphere, and our Sages have, in this astronomical question,
abandoned their own theory in favour of the theory of others. Thus,
it is distinctly stated," The wise men of other nations have
defeated the wise men of IsraeM' It is quite right that our Sages
have abandoned their own theory: for speculative matters every
one treats according to the results of his own study, and every one
accepts that which appears to him established by proof.
