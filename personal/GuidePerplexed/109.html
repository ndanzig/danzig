THE original meaning of the word kisse," throne," requires no
comment. Since men of greatness and authority, as, e.g., kings, use
the throne as a seat, and" the throne" thus indicates the rank,
dignity, and position of the person for whom it is made, the
Sanctuary has been styled" the throne," inasmuch as it likewise
indicates the superiority of I-Em who manifests Himself, and
causes His light and glory to dwell therein. Comp." A glorious
throne on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary"
(Jer. xvii.12). For the same reason the heavens are called" throne,"
for to the mind of him who observes them with intelligence they
suggest the Omnipotence of the Being which has called them into
existence, regulates their motions, and governs the sublunary
world by their beneficial influence: as we read," Thus saith the
Lord, The heavens are my throne and the earth my footstool" (Isa.
1xvi. 1); i.e., they testify to my Existence, my Essence, and my
Omnipotence, as the throne testifies to the greatness of him who is
worthy to occupy it.
This is the idea which true believers should entertain; not,
however, that the Omnipotent, Supreme God is supported by any
material object; for God is incorporeal, as we shall prove further
on; how, then, can He be said to occupy any space, or rest on a
body ? The fact which I wish to point out is this : every place
distinguished by the Almighty, and chosen to receive His light and
splendour, as, for instance, the Sanctuary or the Heavens, is
termed" throne" : and, taken in a wider sense, as in the passage"
For my hand is upon the throne of God" (Exod. xvii. 16)," the
throne" denotes here the Essence and Greatness of God. These,
however (the Essence and Greatness of God) need not be
considered as something separate from the God Himself or as part
of the Creation, so that God would appear to have existed both
without the throne, and with the throne: such a belief would be
undoubtedly heretical. It is distinctly stated," Thou, 0 Lord,
remainest for ever; Thy throne from generation to generation"
(Lam. v. 19). By" Thy throne" we must, therefore, understand
something inseparable from God. On that account, both here and
in all similar passages. the word" throne" denotes God's Greatness
and Essence, which are inseparable from His Being.
Our opinion will be further elucidated in the course of this
Treatise.
