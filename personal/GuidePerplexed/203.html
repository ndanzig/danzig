THE theory of Aristotle in respect to the causes of the motion of
the spheres led him to assume the existence of Intelligences.
Although this theory consists of assertions which cannot be
proved, yet it is the least open to doubt, and is more systematic
than any other, as has been stated by Alexander in the book called
The Origin of the Universe. It includes maxims which are identical
with those taught in Scripture, and it is to a still greater extent in
harmony with doctrines contained in well-known genuine
Midrashim, as will be explained by me. For this reason I will cite
his views and his proofs, and collect from them what coincides
with the teachings of Scripture, and agrees with the doctrine held
by our Sages.
