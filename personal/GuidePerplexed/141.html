THE Hebrew nefesh (soul) is a homonymous noun, signifying the
vitality which is common to all living, sentient beings. E.g."
wherein there is a living soul" (nefesh) (Gen. i. 30). It denotes also
blood," as in" Thou shalt not eat the blood (nefesh) with the meat"
(Dent. xii. 23). Another signification of the term is" reason," that
is, the distinguishing characteristic of man, as in" As the Lord
liveth that made us this soul" (Jer. xxxviii. 16). It denotes also the
part of man that remains after his death (nefesh, soul) comp." But
the soul (nefesh) of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life (I
Sam. XXV. 29). Lastly, it denotes" will" ; comp." To bind his
princes at his will" (be-nafsho) (PS. CV. 22): Thou wilt not deliver
me unto the will (be-nefesh) of my enemies" (Ps. xli. 3): and
according to my opinion, it has this meaning also in the following
passages," If it be your will (nafshekem) that I should bury my
dead" (Gen. xxiii. 8):" Though Moses and Samuel stood before
me, yet my will (nafshi) could not be toward this people" (Jer. xv.
1), that is, I had no pleasure in them, I did not wish to preserve
them. When nefesh is used in reference to God, it has the meaning
(swill," as we have already explained with reference to the
passage," That shall do according to that which is in my will
(bi-lebabi) and in mine intention (be-nafsht)" (I Sam. ii. 35).
Simiiarly we explain the phrase," And his will (nafsho) to trouble
Israel ceased" (Judg. x. 16). Jonathan, the son of Uzziel [in the
Targum of the Prophets], did not translate this passage, because he
understood nafshi to have the first signification, and finding,
therefore, in these words sensation ascribed to God, he omitted
them from his translation. If, however, nefesh be here taken in the
last signification, the sentence can well be explained. For in the
passage which precedes, it is stated that Providence abandoned the
Israelites, and left them on the brink of death: then they cried and
prayed for help, but in vain. When, however, they had thoroughly
repented, when their misery had increased, and their enemy had
had power over them, He showed mercy to them, and His will to
continue their trouble and misery ceased. Note it well, for it is
remarkable. The preposition ba in this passage has the force of the
preposition min (" from" or 11 of" ): and ba'amal is identical with
me'amal. Grammarians give many instances of this use of the
preposition ba :" And that which remaineth of (ba) the flesh and of
(ba) the bread" (Lev. viii. 32):" If there remains but few of (ba)
the years" (ib. xxv. 52):" Of (ba) the strangers and of (ba) those
born in the land" (Exod. xii. 19).
