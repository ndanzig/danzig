IN this chapter I will first expound my view on this question, and
then support it by argument-not by such arguments as those of the
Mutakallemim, who believe that they have proved the Crtatio ex
nihilo. I will not deceive myself, and consider dialectical methods
as proofs: and the fact that a certain proposition has been proved
by a dialectical argument win never induce me to accept that
proposition, but, on the contrary, will weaken my faith in it, and
cause me to doubt it. For when we understand the fallacy of a
proof, our faith in the proposition itself is shaken. It is therefore
better that a proposition which cannot be demonstrated be received
as an axiom, or that one of the two opposite solutions of the
problem be accepted on authority. The methods by which the
Mutakallemirn proved the Crtatio ex nihilo have already been
described by me, and I have exposed their weak points. As to the
proofs of Aristotle and his followers for the Eternity of the
Universe, they are, according to my opinion, not conclusive; they
are open to strong objections, as will be explained. I intend to
show that the theory of the Creation, as taught in Scripture,
contains nothing that is impossible; and that all those
philosophical arguments which seem to disprove our view contain
weak points which make them inconclusive, and render the attacks
on our view untenable. Since I am convinced of the correctness of
my method, and consider either of the two theories-viz., the
Eternity of the Universe, and the Creation-as admissible, I accept
the latter on the authority of Prophecy, which can teach things
beyond the reach of philosophical speculation. For the belief in
prophecy is, as will be shown in the course of this treatise,
consistent even with the belief in the Eternity of the Universe.
When I have established the admissibility of our theory, I will, by
philosophical reasoning, show that our theory of the Creation is
more acceptable than that of the Eternity of the Universe; and
although our theory includes points open to criticism, I will show
that there are much stronger reasons for the rejection of the theory
of our opponents.<BR>
I will now proceed to expound the method by which the proofs
given for the Eternity of the Universe can be refuted.
