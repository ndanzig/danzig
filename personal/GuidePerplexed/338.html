THE precepts of the third class are identical with those which we
have enumerated in Hilkot de'ot. Their use is evident; they are
rules concerning moral conduct by which the social relations of
men are regulated. This is sufficiently dear, and I need not dwell
long on it. Know that some precepts prescribe certain acts which
are considered as arbitrary decrees without any purpose, but are
nevertheless the means of acquiring some moral principle. We
shall explain every one of them in its proper place. But of all those
precepts which are mentioned in Hilkot dew, it is distinctly stated
that their object is to inculcate good moral principles.
