THE Hebrew term ahor is a homonym. It is a noun, signifying"
back Comp." Behind (ahare) the tabernacle" (Exod. xxvi. 12) The
spear came out behind him (ahroav)" (2 Sam. ii. 23).
It is next used in reference to time, signifying" after" :" neither
after him (aharav) arose there any like him" (2 Kings xxiii. 25)"
After (ahar) these things" (Gen. xv. 1). In this sense the word
occurs frequently.
The term includes also the idea of following a thing and of
conforming with the moral principles of some other being. Comp."
Ye shall walk after (ahare) the Lord, your God" (Dent. xiii. 5):"
They shall walk after (ahare) the Lord" (Hos. xi. 10), i.e., follow
His will, walk in the way of His actions, and imitate His virtues:"
He walked after (ahare) the commandment" (ib. v.11). In this
sense the word occurs in Exod us XXXiii. 20," And thou shalt see
my back" (ahorai): thou shalt perceive that which follows me, is
similar to me, and is the result of my will, i.e., all things created by
me, as will be explained in the course of this treatise.
