THE sublime and great subject which Ezekiel by prophetic
impulse began to teach us in the description of the Mercabah, is
exactly the same which Isaiah taught us in general outlines,
because he did not require all the detail. Isaiah says," I saw the
Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled
the temple. Above it stood seraphims," etc. (Isa. vi. 1 seq.). Our
Sages have already stated all this clearly, and called our attention
to it. For they say that the vision of Ezekiel is the same as that of
Isaiah, and illustrate their view by the following simile :-Two men
saw the king riding, the one a townsman, the other a countryman.
The former, seeing that his neighbours know well how the king
rides, simply tells them that he saw the king; but the villager,
wishing to tell his friends things which they do not know, relates in
detail how the king was riding, describes his followers, and the
officers who execute his order and command. This remark is a
most useful hint; it is contained in the following passage (Hagigab,
13 b) :" Isaiah saw all that has been seen by Ezekiel: Isaiah is like
a townsman that sees the king, Ezekiel like a countryman that sees
the king." These words can be explained in the manner which I
have just mentioned, viz., the generation of Isaiah did not require
the detailed description: his account," I saw the Lord," etc.,
sufficed. The generation of the Babylonian exile wanted to learn
all the details. It is, however, possible that the author of this saying
held Isaiah as more perfect than Ezekiel, so that the vision might
have overawed Ezekiel and appeared fearful to him; but Isaiah was
so familiar with it that he did not consider it necessary to
communicate it to others as a new thing, especially as it was well
known to the intelligent.
