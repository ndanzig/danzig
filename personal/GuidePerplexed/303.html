WHEN Ezekiel recalled to memory the form of the Chariot, which
he described in the beginning of the book, the same vision
presented itself to him a second time; in this vision he was borne
to Jerusalem. He explains in describing it things which have not
been made clear at first, e.g., he substitutes the term" cherubim"
for Hayyot, whereby he expresses that the Hayyot of the first vision
are likewise angels like the cherubim. He says, therefore:" Where
the cherubims went, the Ofannim went by them: and when the
cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the
same Ofannim also turned not from beside them" (x. 16). By these
words he shows how closely connected the two motions are [viz.,
that of the Rayyot and that of the Ofannim]. The prophet adds,"
This is the Hayyah that I saw under the God of Israel by the river
of Chebar: and I knew that they were cherubims" (ver. 20). He
thus describes the same forms and the same motions, and states
that the Hayyot and the cherubim are identical. A second point is
then made clear in this second description, namely, that the
Ofannim are spherical; for the prophet says," As for the Ofannim,
it was cried unto them in my hearing, o sphere" (ver. 13). A third
point concerning the Ofannim is illustrated here in the following
words:" To the place whither the head looked they followed it:
they turned not as they went" (ver. 11). The motion of the
Ofannim is thus described as involuntary, and directed" to the
place whither the head looketh: and of this it is stated that it
moves" whither the spirit is to go" (i. 20). A fourth point is added
concerning the Ofannim, namely," And the Ofannim were full of
eyes round about, even the Ofannim that they four had" (x. 12).
This has not been mentioned before. In this second description
there are further mentioned" their flesh, and their backs, and their
hands, and their wings" (ibid.), whilst in the first account none of
these is mentioned: and it is only stated that they are bodies.
Though they are endowed in the second account with flesh, hands,
and wings, no form is given to them. In the second account each
Ofan is attributed to a cherub," one Ofan by one cherub, and
another Ofan by another cherub." The four Hayyot are then
described as one Hayyah on account of their interjoining:" This is
the Hayyah that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of
Chebar" (ver. 20). Also the Olannim, though being four in
number, as has been mentioned, are called" one Ofan upon the
earth" (ver. 15), because they interjoin, and" they four have one
likeness" (ver. 16). This is the additional explanation which the
second vision gives of the form of the Hayyot and the Ofannim.
