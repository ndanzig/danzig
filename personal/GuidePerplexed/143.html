THE Hebrew kanaf is a homonym; most of its meanings are
metaphorical. Its primary signification is" wing of a flying
creature," e.g.," Any winged (kanaf) fowl that flieth in the air"
(Deut. iv. 17).
The term was next applied figuratively to the wings or comers of
garments comp." upon the four corners (kanfoth) of thy vesture"
(ib. xxii. 12).
It was also used to denote the ends of the inhabited part of the
earth, and the corners that are most distant from our habitation.
Comp." That it might take hold of the ends (kanfoth) of the earth"
(job xxxviii. 13):" From the uttermost part (kenaf) of the earth
have we heard songs" (Isa. xxiv. 16).
Ibn Ganab (in his Book of Hebrew Roots) says that kenaf is used in
the sense of" concealing," in analogy with the Arabic kanaftu
alshaian," I have hidden something," and accordingly explains,
Isaiah xxx. 20," And thy teacher will no longer be hidden or
concealed." It is a good explanation, and I think that kenaf has the
same meaning in Deuteronomy xxiii. 1," He shall not take away
the cover (kenaf) of his father" : also in," Spread, therefore, thy
cover (kenafeka) over thine handmaid" (Ruth iii. 9). In this sense, I
think, the word is figuratively applied to God and to angels (for
angels are not corporeal, according to my opinion, as I shall
explain). Ruth ii. 12 must therefore be translated" Under whose
protection (kenafav) thou art come to trust" : and wherever the
word occurs in reference to angels, it means concealment. You
have surely noticed the words of Isaiah (Isa. Vi. 2)," With twain
he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet." Their
meaning is this: The cause of his (the angel's) existence is hidden
and concealed; this is meant by the covering of the face. The
things of which he (the angel) is the cause, and which are called"
his feet" (as I stated in speaking of the homonym regel, are
likewise concealed: for the actions of the intelligences are not
seen, and their ways are, except after long study, not understood,
on account of two reasons -- the one of which is contained in their
own properties, the other in ourselves: that is to say, because our
perception is imperfect and the ideals are difficult to be fully
comprehended. As regards the phrase" and with twain he flieth," I
shall explain in a special chapter (x1ix.) why flight has been
attributed to angels.
