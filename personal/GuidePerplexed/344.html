THE precepts of the ninth class are those enumerated in the
Section on Love. Their reason is obvious. The actions prescribed
by them serve to remind us continually of God, and of our duty to
fear and to love Him, to keep all His commandments, and to
believe concerning God that which every religious person must
believe. This class includes the laws of Prayer, Reading of Shema,
Grace, and duties connected with these, Blessing of the priests,
Tefillin, Mezuzah, Zizit, acquiring a scroll of the Law, and reading
in it at certain times. The performance of all these precepts
inculcates into our heart useful lessons. All this is clear, and a
further explanation is superfluous, as being a mere repetition and
nothing else.
