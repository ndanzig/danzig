ALL the great evils which men cause to each other because of
certain intentions, desires, opinions, or religious principles, are
likewise due to non-existence, because they originate in ignorance,
which is absence of wisdom. A blind man, for example, who has
no guide, stumbles constantly, because he cannot see, and causes
injury and harm to himself and others. In the same manner various
classes of men, each man in proportion to his ignorance, bring
great evils upon themselves and upon other individual members of
the species. If men possessed wisdom, which stands in the same
relation to the form of man as the sight to the eye, they would not
cause any injury to themselves or to others: for the knowledge of
truth removes hatred and quarrels, and prevents mutual injuries.
This state of society is promised to us by the prophet in the words
:" And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb," etc.:" and the cow and
the bear shall feed together," etc.: and" the sucking child shall
play on the hole of the asp," etc. (Isa. id. 6 seq). The prophet also
points out what will be the cause of this change: for he says that
hatred, quarrel, and fighting will come to an end, because men will
then have a true knowledge of God." They shall not hurt nor
destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the
knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea" (ibid. ver. g).
Note it.
