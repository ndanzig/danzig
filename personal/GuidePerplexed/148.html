WHENEVER in the Pentateuch the term" to hear" is applied to
God, Onkelos, the Proselyte, does not translate it literally, but
paraphrases it, merely expressing that a certain speech reached
Him, i.e., He perceived it, or that He accepted it or did not accept,
when it refers to supplication and prayer as its object. The words"
God heard" are therefore paraphrased by him regularly either," It
was heard before the Lord," or" He accepted" when employed in
reference to supplication and prayer; [e.g.]" I will. surely accept,"
lit. I will surely hear" (Exod. XXii. 22). This principle is followed
by Onkelos in his translation of the Pentateuch without any
exception. But as regards the verb" to see," (raah), his renderings
vary in a remarkable manner, and I was unable to discern his
principle or method. In some instances he translates literally," and
God saw" : in others he paraphrases" it was revealed before the
Lord." The use of the phrase va-haza adonai by Onkelos is
sufficient evidence that the term haza in Chaldee is homonymous,
and that it denotes mental perception as well as the sensation of
sight. This being the case, I am surprised that, in some instances
avoiding the literal rendering, he substituted for it" And it was
revealed before the Lord." When I, however, examined the various
readings in the version of Onkelos, which 1 either saw myself or
heard from others during the time of my studies, 1 found that the
term" to see" when connected with wrong, injury, or violence,
was paraphrased," It was manifest before
was manifest before the Lord."
There is no doubt that the term haza in Chaldee denotes complete
apprehension and reception of the object in the state in which it
has been perceived. When Onkelos, therefore, found the verb" to
see" connected with the object" wrong," he did not render it
literally, but paraphrased it," It was revealed before the Lord."
Now, I noticed that in all instances of the Pentateuch where seeing
is ascribed to God, he translated it literally, except those instances
which I will mention to you :" For my affliction was revealed
before the Lord" (Gen. xxix. 32):" For all that Laban doeth unto
thee is revealed before me" (ib. xxxi. 12):-although the first
person in the sentence refers to the angel [and not to God],
Onkelos does not ascribe to him that perception which implies
complete comprehension of the object, because the object is"
iniquity" -" The oppression of the children of Israel was known to
the Lord" (Exod. ii. 25):" The oppression of my people was surely
known to me" (ib. iii. 7):" The affliction is known to me" (ib. 9):"
Their oppression is known to me" (ib. iv. 31):" This people is
known to me" (ib. xxxii. 9), i.e., their rebellion is known to
mecomp. the Targurn of the passage," And God saw the children
of Israel (ib. ii. 25), which is equal to" He saw their affliction and
their trouble" " And it was known to the Lord, and he abhorred
them" (Dent. xxxii. 19):" It was known to him that their power
was gone" (ib. 36): in this instance the object of the perception is
likewise the wrong done to the Israelites, and the increasing power
of the enemy. In all these examples Onkelos is consistent,
following the maxim expressed in the words," Thou canst not look
on iniquity" (Hab. i. 13): wherefore he renders the verb" to see,"
when referring to oppression or rebellion, It is revealed before
him, etc. This appropriate and satisfactory explanation, the
correctness of which 1 do not doubt, is weakened by three
passages, in which, according to this view, I expected to find the
verb" to see" paraphrased" to be revealed before him," but found
instead the literal rendering" to see in the various copies of the
Targum. The following are the three passages" And God saw that
the wickedness of man was great upon the earth (Gen. vi. 6)" And
the Lord saw the earth, and behold it was corrupt (ib. vi. 12): and
God saw that Leah was hated" (ib. xxx. 3). It appears to me that in
these passages there is a mistake, which has crept into the copies
of the Targum, since we do not possess the Targum in the original
manuscript of Onkelos, for in that case we should have assumed
that he had a satisfactory explanation of it.
In rendering Genesis xxii. 8," the lamb is known to the Lord," he
either wished to indicate that the Lord was not expected to seek
and to bring it, or he considered it inappropriate, in Chaldee to
connect the divine perception with one of the lower animals.
However, the various copies of the Targum must be carefully
examined with regard to this point, and if you still find those
passages the same as I quoted them, I cannot explain what he
meant.
