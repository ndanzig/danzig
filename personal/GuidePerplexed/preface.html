The first Edition of the English Translation of Maimonides Dainlat
al-Hairin being exhausted without having fully supplied the
demand, I prepared a second, revised edition of the Translation. In
the new edition the three volumes of the first edition have been
reduced to one volume by the elimination of the notes; besides
Hebrew words and phrases have been eliminated or transliterated.
By these changes the translator sought to produce a cheap edition
in order to bring the work of Maimonides within the reach of all
studcnts of Theology and Jewish Literature.<BR>

PREFACE TO VOLUME ONE OF THE FIRST EDITION<BR>
IN compliance with a desire repeatedly expressed by the
Committee of the Hebrew Literature Society, I have undertaken to
translate Maimonides Dalalat al-Hairin, better known by the
Hebrew title Moreh Nebuchim, and I offer the first instalment of
my labours in the present volume. This contains--(1) A short Life
of Maimonides, in which special attention is given to his alleged
apostasy. (2) An analysis of the whole of the Moreh Nebuchim. (3)
A translation of the First Part of this work from the Arabic, with
explanatory and critical notes.<BR>
Parts of the Translation have been contributed by Mr. Joseph
Abrahams, B.A., Ph.D., and Rev. H. Gollancz -- the Introduction
by the former, and the first twenty--five chapters by the latter.
In conclusion I beg to tender my thanks to Rev. A. Loewy, Editor
of the Publications of the Hebrew Literature Society, for his
careful revision of my manuscript and proofs, and to Mr. A.
Neubauer, M.A., for his kindness in supplying me with such
information as I required.<BR>
M. FRIEDLANDER.<BR>
