IT might be thought that the Hebrew words temunah and tabnit
have one and the same meaning, but this is not the case. Tabnit,
derived from the verb banah (he built), signifies the build and
construction of a thing-that is to say, its figure, whether square,
round, triangular, or of any other shape. Comp." the pattern
(tabnit) of the Tabernacle and the pattern (tabnit) of all its vessels"
(Exod. xxv. 9):" according to the pattern (tabnit) which thou wast
shown upon the mount" (Exod. xxv, 40):" the form of any bird"
(Deut. iv. 17):" the form (tabnit) of a hand" (Ezek. viii. 3):" the
pattern (tabnit) of the porch" (I Chron. xxviii. 11). In all these
quotations it is the shape which is referred to. Therefore the
Hebrew language never employs the word tabnit in speaking of the
qualities of God Almighty.
The term temunah, on the other hand, is used in the Bible in three
different senses. It signifies, first, the outlines of things which are
perceived by our bodily senses, i.e., their shape and form; as, e.g.,"
And ye make an image the form (temunat) of some likeness"
(Dent. iv. 16):" for ye saw no likeness" (temunah) (Dent. iv. 15).
Secondly, the forms of our imagination, i.e., the impressions
retained in imagination when the objects have ceased to affect our
senses. In this sense it is used in the passage which begins" In
thoughts from the visions of the night" (job iv. 13), and which
concludes" it remained but I could not recognize its sight, only an
image -temunah was before my eyes," i.e., an image which
presented itself to my sight during sleep. Thirdly, the true form of
an object, which is perceived only by the intellect : and it is in this
third signification that the term is applied to God. The words" And
the similitude of the Lord shall he behold" (Num. xii. 8) therefore
mean" he shall comprehend the true essence of the Lord."
