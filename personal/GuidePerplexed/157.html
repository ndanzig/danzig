ON attributes; remarks more recondite than the preceding. It is
known that existence is an accident appertaining to all things, and
therefore an element superadded to their essence. This must
evidently be the case as regards everything the existence of which
is due to some cause: its existence is an element superadded to its
essence. But as regards a being whose existence is not due to any
cause-God alone is that being, for His existence, as we have said,
is absolute-existence and essence are perfectly identical; He is not
a substance to which existence is joined as an accident, as an
additional element. His existence is always absolute, and has never
been a new element or an accident in Him. Consequently God
exists without possessing the attribute of existence. Similarly He
lives, without possessing the attribute of life; knows, without
possessing the attribute of knowledge; is omnipotent without
possessing the attribute of omnipotence; is wise, without
possessing the attribute of wisdom: all this reduces itself to one
and the same entity; there is no plurality in Him, as will be shown.
It is further necessary to consider that unity and plurality are
accidents supervening to an object according as it consists of many
elements or of one. This is fully explained in the book called
Metaphysics. In the same way as number is not the substance of
the things numbered, so is unity not the substance of the thing
which has the attribute of unity, for unity and plurality are
accidents belonging to the category of discrete quantity, and
supervening to such objects as are capable of receiving them.
To that being, however, which has truly simple, absolute existence,
and in which composition is inconceivable, the accident of unity is
as inadmissible as the accident of plurality; that is to say, God's
unity is not an element superadded, but He is One without
possessing the attribute of unity. The investigation of this subject,
which is almost too subtle for our understanding, must not be
based on current expressions employed in describing it, for these
you know that something is in the house, but not exactly what, you
ask what is in that house, and you are told, not a plant nor a
mineral. You have thereby obtained some special knowledge of
the thing; you have learnt that it is a living being, although you do
not yet know what kind of a living being it is. The negative
attributes have this in common with the positive, that they
necessarily circumscribe the object to some extent, although such
circumscription consists only in the exclusion of what otherwise
would not be excluded. In the following point, however, the
negative attributes are distinguished from the positive. The
positive attributes, although not peculiar to one thing, describe a
portion of what we desire to know, either some part of its essence
or some of its accidents: the negative attributes, on the other hand,
do not, as regards the essence of the thing which we desire to
know, in any way tell us what it is, except it be indirectly, as has
been shown in the instance given by us.
After this introduction, I would observe that, -- as has already been
shown -God's existence is absolute, that it includes no
composition, as will be proved, and that we comprehend only the
fact that He exists, not His essence. Consequently it is a false
assumption to hold that He has any positive attribute: for He does
not possess existence in addition to His essence: it therefore cannot
be said that the one may be described as an attribute [of the other];
much less has He [in addition to His existence] a compound
essence, consisting of two constituent elements to which the
attribute could refer: still less has He accidents, which could be
described by an attribute. Hence it is clear that He has no positive
attribute whatever. The negative attributes, however, are those
which are necessary to direct the mind to the truths which we must
believe concerning God; for, on the one hand, they do not imply
any plurality, and, on the other, they convey to man the highest
possible knowledge of God; e.g., it has been established by proof
that some being must exist besides those things which can be
perceived by the senses, or apprehended by the mind; when we say
of this being, that it exists, we mean that its non-existence is
impossible. We then perceive that such a being is not, for instance,
like the four elements, which are inanimate, and we therefore say
that it is living, expressing thereby that it is not dead. We call such
a being incorporeal, because we notice that it is unlike the
heavens, which are living, but material. Seeing that it is also
different from the intellect, which, though incorporeal and living,
owes its existence to some cause, we say it is the first, expressing
thereby that its existence is not due to any cause. We further
notice, that the existence, that is the essence, of this being is not
limited to its own existence: many existences emanate from it, and
its influence is not like that of the fire in producing heat, or that of
the sun in sending forth light, but consists in constantly giving
them stability and order by well-established rule, as we shall show:
we say, on that account, it has power, wisdom, and will, i.e., it is
not feeble or ignorant, or hasty, and does not abandon its creatures:
when we say that it is not feeble, we mean that its existence is
capable of producing the existence of many other things: by saying
that it is not ignorant, we mean" it perceives" or" it lives," -- for
everything that perceives is living-by saying" it is not hasty, and
does not abandon its creatures," we mean that all these creatures
preserve a certain order and arrangement: they are not left to
themselves; they are not produced aimlessly, but whatever
condition they receive from that being is given with design and
intention. We thus learn that there is no other being like unto God,
and we say that He is One, i.e., there are not more Gods than one.
It has thus been shown that every attribute predicated of God either
denotes the quality of an action, or-when the attribute is intended
to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself, and not of His
actions-the negation of the opposite. Even these negative attributes
must not be formed and applied to God, except in the way in
which, as you know, sometimes an attribute is negatived in
reference to a thing, although that attribute can naturally never be
applied to it in the same sense, as, e.g., we say," This wall does
not see." Those who read the present work are aware that,
notwithstanding all the efforts of the mind, we can obtain no
knowledge of the essence of the heavens -- a revolving substance
which has been measured by us in spans and cubits, and examined
even as regards the proportions of the several spheres to each other
and respecting most of their motions-although we know that they
must consist of matter and form; but the matter not being the same
as sublunary matter, we can only describe the heavens in terms
expressing negative properties, but not in terms denoting positive
qualities. Thus we say that the heavens are not light, not heavy, not
passive and therefore not subject to impressions, and that they do
not possess the sensations of taste and smell: or we use similar
negative attributes. All this we do, because we do not know their
substance. What, then, can be the result of our efforts, when we try
to obtain a knowledge of a Being that is free from substance, that
is most simple, whose existence is absolute, and not due to any
cause, to whose perfect essence nothing can be superadded, and
whose perfection consists, as we have shown, in the absence of all
defects. All we understand is the fact that He exists, that He is a
Being to whom none of His creatures is similar, who has nothing
in common with them, who does not include plurality, who is
never too feeble to produce other beings, and whose relation to the
universe is that of a steersman to a boat: and even this is not a real
relation, a real simile, but serves only to convey to us the idea that
God rules the universe: that is, that He gives it duration, and
preserves its necessary arrangement. This subject will be treated
more fully. Praised be He! In the contemplation of His essence, our
comprehension and knowledge prove insufficient; in the
examination of His works, how they necessarily result from His
will, our knowledge proves to be ignorance, and in the endeavour
to extol Him in words, all our efforts in speech are mere weakness
and failure
