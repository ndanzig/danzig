THE three verbs raah, hibbit, and hazab, which denote" he
perceived with the eye," are also used figuratively in the sense of
intellectual perception. As regards the first of these verbs this is
well known, e.g., And he looked (va-yar) and behold a well in the
field" (Gen. XXiX. 2) here it signifies ocular perception:" yea, my
heart has seen (raah) much of wisdom and of knowledge" (Eccles.
i. 16): in this passage it refers to the intellectual perception.
In this figurative sense the verb is to be understood, when applied
to God e.g.," I saw (raiti) the Lord" (I Kings xxii. 19):" And the
Lord appeared (va-yera) unto him (Gen. xviii. 1):" And God saw
(va-yar) that it was good" (Gen. i. 10)" I beseech thee, show me
(harem) thy glory" (Exod. xxxiii. 18):" And they saw (va-yiru) the
God of Israel" (Exod. xxiv. 10). All these instances refer to
intellectual perception, and by no means to perception with the eye
as in its literal meaning : for, on the one hand, the eye can only
perceive a corporeal object, and in connection with it certain
accidents, as colour, shape, etc.: and, on the other hand, God does
not perceive by means of a corporeal organ, as will be explained.
In the same manner the Hebrew hibbit signifies" he viewed with
the eye; comp." Look (tabbit) not behind thee" (Gen. xix. 17): But
his wife looked (va-tabbet) back from him" (Gen. xix. 26):" And if
one look (venibbat) unto the land" (Isa. V. 30): and figuratively,"
to view and observe" with the intellect," to contemplate" a thing
till it be understood. In this sense the verb is used in passages like
the following:" He hath not beheld (hibbit) iniquity in Jacob"
(Num. xxiii. 21): for" iniquity" cannot be seen with the eye. The
words," And they looked (ve-hibbitu) after Moses" (Exod. xxxiii.
8) -- in addition to the literal understanding of the phrasewere
explained by our Sages in a figurative sense. According to them,
these words mean that the Israelites examined and criticised the
actions and sayings of Moses. Compare also" Contemplate
(habbet), I pray thee, the heaven" (Gen.xv.5); for this took place in
a prophetic vision. This verb, when applied to God, is employed in
this figurative sense; e.g., 46 to look (mehabbit) upon God"
(Exod. iii. 6)" And the similitude of the Lord shall he behold"
(yabbit) (Num. xii. 8): And thou canst not look (habbet) on
iniquity" (Hab. i. 13).
The same explanation applies to hazah. It denotes to view with the
eye, as:" And let our eye look (ve-tahaz) upon Zion" (Mic. iv. 11):
and also figuratively, to perceive mentally :" which he saw (hazah)
concerning Judah and Jerusalem" (Isa. i. 1):" The word of the
Lord came unto Abraham in a vision" (mahazeh) (Gen. xv. 1): in
this sense hazab is used in the phrase," Also they saw (va-yehezu)
God" (Exod. xxiv. 11). Note this well.
