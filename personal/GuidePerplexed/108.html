ORIGINALLY the Hebrew term makom (place) applied both to a
particular spot and to space in general subsequently it received a
wider signification and denoted" position," or degree," as regards
the perfection of man in certain things. We say, e.g., this man
occupies a certain place in such and such a subject. In this sense
this term, as is well known, is frequently used by authors, e.g.," He
fills his ancestors' place (makom) in point of wisdom and piety" :"
the dispute still remains in its place" (makom), i.e., in statu quo
[ante]. In the verse," Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His
place" (mekomo) (Ezek. iii. 12), makom has this figurative
meaning, and the verse may be paraphrased" Blessed be the Lord
according to the exalted nature of His existence," and wherever
makom is applied to God, it expresses the same idea, namely, the
distinguished position of His existence, to which nothing is equal
or comparable, as will be shown below (chap. Ivi.).
It should be observed that when we treat in this work of any
homonym, we do not desire you to confine yourself to that which
is stated in that particular chapter: but we open for you a portal and
direct your attention to those significations of the word which are
suited to our purpose, though they may not be complete from a
philological point of view. You should examine the prophetical
books and other works composed by men of science, notice the
meaning of every word which occurs in them, and take homonyms
in that sense which is in harmony with the context. What 1 say in a
particular passage is a key for the comprehension of all similar
passages. For example, we have explained here makom in the
sentence" Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place"
(mekomo): but you must understand that the word makom has the
same signification in the passage" Behold, a place (makom) is
with me" (Exod. xxxiii. 26), viz., a certain degree of
contemplation and intellectual intuition (not of ocular inspection),
in addition to its literal meanling" a place," viz., the mountain
which was pointed out to Moses for seclusion and for the
attainment of perfection.
