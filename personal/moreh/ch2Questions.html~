<h2> The Sin of Adam HaRishon</h2>
<h3>or What is it to be a human being</h3>

<ul>
<li>Read <i>Guide</i> chapter 2. (Bear in mind that the Rambam is not really concerned with
explaining the Bible in a literal sense.  He employs the notion "the Torah speaks
in human language to give license to figurative interpretations while still claiming
adherence to the intent of the text. )
<h3>Questions for discussion</h3>
<li>What is man's state before the sin? What kinds of things did he contemplate? 
What was he doing?
<li>What is man's state after the sin?  With what did he engage his time?
<li>What is the man's sin?
<li>Does it make sense to say that eating of the tree was false? <!--this is 
the usual asnwer given -->
<li>Does Rambam answer the question: How could it be wrong to eat of the tree
before knowing wrong from right, i.e. How could man justly be punished?
<!-- no, he answers the question why did not G-d create man as an angel?
answer: A human being must engage in this world. It is a description of man's nature, not 
an historical account -->
<li>Was man actually punished? <!-- no, he just involved himself in another occupation-->

<li>According to N. Leibowitz's explanation of Abarbanel (and Rambam), man was partly 
involved in questions of the physical world, his sin was over involvement.
Could this be the Rambam view as well?
<li>Z. Harvey suggests that Rambam means that man was lead by the intellect, and his sin was 
being lead by physical desires. Does this fit with the Ramabam? <!-- a plant does 
photosynthesis (or a man fulfills his nature), that is not good, it is its nature, can we called 
that emet?? -- rather, rambam means that the if there is to be a world of action then we must 
have good and bad evaluations.  if we have no good and bad then we can't exist very long, 
because we would have no way to know whether to eat or not.  is eating an apple good? 
is preserving life good.  Harvey answers that we say yes for pedagological reasons, but that 
really there is no "good" .  but there is a good as long as we are to exist.  
harvey says we should be lead by 
our intellect, but i ask, lead to do what?  why would we do any action at all if there is no good.
rather the state of man was one of pure reason, math , like an angel a "star">
<li>Which questions did man address? (What are mephursamot)
   <ol> 
   <li>Is this a rock? <!-- he named the animals, that is all we see he did, pure science -->
   <li>Is it good to eat a rock? Is a potatoe good to eat? <!-- eve sinned by getting confused, she once was involved in good/bad questions of eating which lead to real mefursamot.  from q's of physically good to q's of morally good. -->
   <li>Is pink a nice color to wear?
 
   </ol>
<li> The tree was good to eat physically, was it morally good to eat? <!-- no, but 
he should not have even bothered with asking the question since it is not a emet question -->
<li>Does Rambam refute each claim of the fool? <!-- In fact, he reverses each point, ex. was star after  -->
</ul>
