                As members of a scientifically educated society, we must ask ourselves the&nbsp;question: What theological basis should we use to relate to the natural world?&nbsp;Can we derive truths about the Torah and G-d from scientific study of nature&nbsp;or is science at best irrelevant to our understanding of G-d or at worst is&nbsp;science misleading?&nbsp;<BR>
                <BR>
                The central event of Sefer Shmot, it is safe to say, is the Exodus from&nbsp;Egypt. For many rishonim the miraculous character of the Exodus&nbsp;demonstrates that G-d controls nature and is free to act as He wishes even in&nbsp;contradiction to nature.  From this we learn that G-d governs the world and&nbsp;has not abandoned it to chance as the non-believer claims, “G-d has forsaken&nbsp;the land.”  Ezekiel 8:12.  For these rishonim the miracles of the Exodus prove&nbsp;<BR>
                G-d’s existence and providence.<BR>
                <BR>
                Such authorities as Yahudah Halevi in Sefer Hakuzari, (1) R”an in his&nbsp;drashot, (2) Hasdai Crescas and Ramban all derive this fundamental principle&nbsp;of hashgacha pratit, G-d’s individual providence, from the Exodus.  For&nbsp;example Hasdai Crescas writes in his introduction to Ohr Hashem:  ”  ‘I am&nbsp;the Lord your G-d…’  Behold, the word “G-d” (power) [elohut] means that He&nbsp;is free to act on all existence.  And according to this ‘…who took you out of&nbsp;Egypt.’  is a proof to this belief.  That is, that from here we derive that G-d is&nbsp;<BR>
                free to act as he pleases, and all of creation is in his hand as clay in the hand&nbsp;of the potter. (3)”   By witnessing a miracle, we discover the true nature of&nbsp;G-d, and that is, that he is able to act with complete freedom and is bound by&nbsp;no rule, not even the rules of nature.&nbsp;<BR>
                <BR>
                Ramban goes even further by extrapolating from the open miracles of&nbsp;Exodus that, in fact, all the minor events of life are also directly the result of&nbsp;G-d’s will and do not merely follow laws of nature.   Thus, open miracles show&nbsp;G-d’s constant hand in human existence and His presence in the Universe.&nbsp;Ramban does not hold that G-d set up the laws of nature to govern the world,&nbsp;but, in fact, every seemingly natural event in the world is a unique desire of&nbsp;G-d.  A blade of grass does not grow if G-d does not explicitly will it.  The true&nbsp;explanation for the seemingly natural events of the world is G-d’s will, or what&nbsp;<BR>
                Ramban calls  ‘hidden miracles’.

                “And from the great and well-known miracles a man comes to admit to&nbsp;hidden miracles which are the foundation of the whole Torah.  A person has&nbsp;no portion in the Torah of Moshe Rabeinu unless he believes that all our&nbsp;matters and circumstances are miracles and they do not follow nature or the&nbsp;general custom of the world …rather, if one does mitzvot he will succeed due&nbsp;to the reward he merits …” (4) If G-d sometimes wills to contravene nature’s&nbsp;supposed laws, then there must also be a will not to contravene them when&nbsp;events follow natural law.  Thus, the Exodus is the proof that ultimately, all the&nbsp;events of man are directly under Divine providence and their appearance to&nbsp;follow natural laws is merely an illusion.<BR>
                <BR>
	Opposition to this opinion is found chiefly in Rambam’s words. In&nbsp;Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah he writes that we do not believe in Moshe because of&nbsp;the miracles but only because the Jewish people experienced prophecy. (5)&nbsp;The miracles only occurred to help the Jewish people out of difficulties,
                but except for the miraculous events of the Sinaitic revelation
                Rambam does not&nbsp;seem to see in miracles any proof to G-d’s existence or providence and does&nbsp;not derive any theological principles from them.<BR>
                <BR>
                Rambam actually believes an important way to understanding G-d is&nbsp;through the scientific study of nature:&nbsp;<BR>
                <BR>
                “I have already let you know that there exists nothing except G-d, may&nbsp;He be exalted, and this existent world and that there is no possible&nbsp;inference proving His existence, may He be exalted, except those&nbsp;deriving from this existent [the Universe] taken as a whole and from its&nbsp;details.  Accordingly, it necessarily behooves one to consider this&nbsp;existent as it is and to derive premises from what is perceived in&nbsp;nature.   For this reason it follows that you should know its perceptible&nbsp;form and nature, and then it will be possible to make an inference from&nbsp;it [the Universe] with regard to what is other than it [G-d].” (6)&nbsp;<BR>
                <BR>
                Rambam not only considers natural laws as real, but as the basis for&nbsp;understanding the Universe and G-d.  Through the study of nature we come&nbsp;to a better understanding of G-d and come closer to Him.  Nature is an&nbsp;expression of G-d, thus natural science is the “Divine Science”.  If anything is&nbsp;misleading, it is miracles for they seem to deny the “Divine” natural laws.&nbsp;Miracles seem to show change and inconsistency in G-d.  Therefore Rambam&nbsp;holds that miracles were pre-programmed into nature from the beginning of&nbsp;creation, and actually also follow rules.<BR>
                <BR>
                Far from being a denial of G-d’s providence, nature is the avenue for&nbsp;the expression of G-d’s providence.  G-d directs nature by setting into motion&nbsp;a series of natural causes.  Thus, by saying G-d causes the snow to fall on&nbsp;Mount Hermon, we do not deny the natural character of this event, we only&nbsp;assert that ultimately G-d is the driving force behind nature.  This idea is&nbsp;central to Rambam’s conception of providence:&nbsp;<BR>
                <BR>
                As regards the immediate causes of things produced… the prophets&nbsp;omitted them and ascribed the production directly to G-d and use such&nbsp;phrases as G-d has done it.  … According to this hypothesis and theory&nbsp;accepted, it is G-d that gave …natural properties to everything… it can&nbsp;consequently be said regarding everything which is produced by any of&nbsp;<BR>
                these causes, that G-d commanded that it should be made or said that&nbsp;it should be so. (7)&nbsp;<BR>
                <BR>
	Both Ramban and Rambam learn about G-d from the physical world.&nbsp;Ramban learns from the exceptions to the rules of nature that there is no&nbsp;natural law and only G-d’s volition.  Rambam learns from G-d’s adherence to&nbsp;natural law that natural science is Divine.  Ramban sees the seemingly&nbsp;natural order of the world as an illusion which may mislead us about G-d.  In&nbsp;truth, he posits, all events are the result of the direct will of G-d.  Rambam&nbsp;sees the natural order as the direct expression of the Divine will.  Through&nbsp;scientific study of nature, we come to a deeper awareness of G-d.  Perhaps&nbsp;Rambam would look at the truly impressive events of everyday life, like the&nbsp;birth of a child and say, “Is there any better proof of G-d’s existence and&nbsp;providence than this?”  Thus, Rambam has a deep appreciation for the world&nbsp;around him.  It is the expression of G-d.&nbsp;<BR>
                <BR>
                According to Rambam what does the Exodus teach us?  In two places&nbsp;Rambam, quoting Sifra, (8) states that the Exodus obliges us to follow the&nbsp;Law of the Torah.  In Mishneh Torah, (9) and similarly in Sefer HaMitzvot, (10)&nbsp;Rambam writes:  “Any one who rejects the laws of ‘fair weights’ it is as if he&nbsp;rejects the Exodus from Egypt, for it is the origin of all mitzvot. Anyone who&nbsp;accepts the laws of ‘fair weights’ admits to the Exodus from Egypt for it is the&nbsp;source of all the commandments.”<BR>
