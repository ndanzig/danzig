<h3>Some Advice from Nachum</h3>

<ul type="circle">
<h3>Unarguably Correct Advice</h3>
<li>If you are cold, put on a sweater. (Don't complain.)
<li>If you are bored, read something. (Don't eat something.)
<li>If you are hungry, have something to eat. (otherwise, you'll be in a bad mood.)
<li>If you are not hungry, don't eat.
<li>If you are tired, go to sleep. <!-- (Don't watch a movie.) -- or Don't be grumpy ->
<li>If you can't sleep, do something. <!-- (Don't try to sleep.) -- or nothing ->
<li>If you are always tired, exercise.
<li>If you are depressed, learn Torah. (Don't eat something.)
<li>If you don't like the food, don't eat it.
<li>If you are sick, have some soup or tea. 
<li>If you run out of food, buy some.

<h3>For the Sick</h3>
<li> You have heard that gargling with salt water solves most throat ailments
but what you haven't heard is that you need to do it for at least 15 minutes.
(you can take a break to breath).  
<li>Salt water gargling also cleans out your sinuses.

<h3>From my experience</h3>

<li>If you burn yourself, put the affected area in very hot water and keep 
raising the temperature as much as you can stand.  Keep the body part hot for
about 15 minutes.  It will turn red like a lobster, but this will bring
important white blood cells to teh area and help it heal.  You
will most likely not get a blister. From Moshe Feinstein.
Same holds true for a crush wound.
<li>Stay well supplied in food, chocolate especially.
<li>Just closing your eyes and keeping quiet is as good as sleeping.
<li>Better to be hungry than full, don't eat too much, but don't go to sleep hungry.
<li>Vary the shoes you wear from day to day.
<h3>Food advice</h3>
<li>Never eat margarine.
<li>Keep an eye on the cake when you are baking. If it is cooking too quickly, turn the heat down, if it is cooking too slowly, turn the heat up.
<li>Cookies should be removed from the oven once they have fully puffed up. Don't wait for them to brown. 
<li>When making apple pie, add water in the middle of the baking process. 
 Also, peel the apples.
<li>Don't store tomatoes or bananas in the refridgerator - they will lose their flavour and texture.
<li>Storing potatoes and onions in the refidgerator will not prolong their life, and may cause mold to grow on them.
<li>Don't use aluminum pots. Use cast iron or stainless steel ones 
<li>Make cholent without any salt, afterward you can add salt.  This will prevent it from sticking.
<li>Don't fry the meat or onion of the cholent.  Simply put meat on bottom, add garlic powder, beans, barley, potatoes, onions (and katchup) add water and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 2 hours.
<li>Add pepper to potatoe kugel.
<li>Use sugar as a savory spice.
<li>After you prepare cookie dough, let is stay in the fridge several days before baking it.
This will greatly improve the taste.
<h3>My preferences</h3>
<li>Serve drinks in the right glass. (On average a glass is better if it is short and wide.)
<li>Don't buy acrilic, only buy wool sweaters.
<li>Oatmeal is good to have for breakfast.
<li>Fried sausages are really good for breakfast.
<li>The best breakfast is nothing at all.
<h3> General advice</h3>
<li>You can't avoid experiencing something. Choose well what you do experience; you will be affected by every experience.  Even lack of anything is an experience.
<li>Be willing to be wrong. Any decision is better than no decision.  Making a decision doesn't mean you're married to the choice.
<li>Failing to make a decision is also a decision. Like any other decision it closes off options.
</ul>

<h3>ND Quotables</h3>

<li>"The world is very simple if you just understand it."
<li>"Well, maybe you're an idiot. You have to remember that is a possibility."
<li>Men are different from dogs. Dogs can be trained. A woman who wants to train a man had better find a dog.
<li>"If you want to be valued by other people you must have a consistent
approach to life (religion). But, if you value yourself, you will 
constantly reshape your philosophy."
<li>"Don't try to prevent the inevitable. Try to attain the unachievable."
