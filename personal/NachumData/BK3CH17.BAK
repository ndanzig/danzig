<P>bible quotes from koren jerusalem bible</P>
<P>moreh quotes from pines</P>
<P>	"Though thy beginning was small, yet thy end will be great. (Job 8:7)" 
 "The opinions of people about providence are five in all.  And all of 
them are ancient; I mean that they are...(p464)"  His intent when he recounts 
a portion of the opinions and says they are ancient he means that they 
existed in the time of the Torah and the prophets. (paraphrase of moreh). 
 The first opinion is that of Epicurus who considered that there is no 
"one who orders, governs, or is concerned with anything" for he rejected 
[belief in] the active cause.  And I shall consider that those maintaining 
this opinion are among those who deny the blessed Name.  They are the ones 
called Epicorsim. And if we explain the word, it is a Greek word.</P>
<P>	"Aristotle has demonstrated that this opinion is inadmissible" It being 
impossible that existence be persistent and not vaporous (<FT 2><LANG 0x4f1b4a00>מאדיים
<FT 1><LANG 0xae160304>), [its elements] fitting one to another, and leading 
to the desired purpose in the components of life [by mere chance].  All 
of this [order] teaches that existence is not by chance, but is by one 
who orders and governs, blessed and elevated be He.</P>
<P>	The second opinion is that of Aristotle, "for he believes that providence 
corresponds to the nature of what exists.(p465)".  By this he means that 
providence is "permanence" even in accordance with the nature of the existence 
and its permanence, whether corresponding to the individuals or the species. 
 [Providence] brings into existence protective faculties for the individuals 
of a species according to what it is.  This is termed providence (<FT 2>
<LANG 0x4f1b4a00>ההשגחה<FT 1><LANG 0xae160304>).  And the term true providence 
(<FT 2><LANG 0x4f1b4a00>ההשגחה האמתית<FT 1><LANG 0xae160304>) refers to 
man (or, individuals)(<FT 2><LANG 0x4f1b4a00>איש<FT 1><LANG 0xae160304>), 
"no species exists outside the mind (p474)".  And by his saying "there 
is likewise an overflow from the providence in question (p465)" he means 
by means of them "which necessitates" and is true "having been given another 
faculty through which every one of them, according to the perfection of 
the individual in question, governs(p465)" and this is seeing into the 
future.</P>
<P>	And by his saying "as, for instance, the circumstances of the individuals 
of every species of plants, animals, and man(p466)" he means that that 
which he grasps them from their doings and their matters and their activities, 
they "exist by chance(p466)" as they occur "and not through the governance 
of one who governs; he means thereby that they are not accompanied by divine 
providence (p466)."  "All that the fork brought up (Samuel I  2:14)" and 
not according to a prearranged order and the result of effects and causes 
and toward one specific individual aim.  Rather, according to the grasp 
of the causes and effects and according to what is intermingled in them 
by the occurence of nature, but not that their coming into being [is] by 
chance and occurance.  For then they would not persist.  And if chance 
is already intermingled also in their coming into existence, for [their 
coming into existence] is not a willful decision, they would immediately 
disappear by chance, even beyond their inevitable natural disappearance. 
 </P>
<P>	Now behold, it is obligatory that chance occurance be intermingled 
in their coming intoexistence because their coming into existence is not 
necessary at all.  Therefore, their disappearance is necessary.  Now behold, 
if the coming into existence of man from the seed of man is not by chance, 
for there is a relationship between the matter and the form [of a thing, 
then] behold, in this regard it is then possible that there should be a 
thing which hinders or prevents [the coming into existence of a man].  
And were it not for it, [his] coming into existence would truly be established 
by that thing from which it comes into existence before it comes into a 
non-existent existence which is caused by the chance intermingling of a 
thing which prevents its existence.  The same holds true regarding the 
perseverence of [an existant thing].  And all this [occurs] without [divine] 
providence or one who orders or who governs, just there is a preserver 
of the species.</P>
<P>	The third opinion is that every thing is [run] with knowledge and providence. 
And by his saying, "Now it is clear that everything that is governed is 
also known. (p466)", he means anything which is unknown can't be governed. 
 And alternatively, anything that is known [can] be governed.  "This is 
the opinion of the Islamic sect, the Ash'ariyya.(p466)."  They hold the 
belief in destiny.  And I have already composed a small treatise on the 
invalidity of this opinion in response to a treatise in support of this 
opinion [written] by a respected scholar whom (which) I have know in my 
tenure.  </P>
<P>	It is appropriate that you should understand that there is a non-forced 
Will which can choose two alternatives.  It chooses one with a clear desire 
and intent.  The matter of free will is really the unification [of the 
choice in actuality].  It must evaluate the two opposing [choices] and 
choose one over the other.  But governance is ....[ Then ] wrote Abu Becher 
Ben Altzig their more well known teaching regarding the matter of arrangeing 
many actions toward one intended objective. And it being that one doesn't 
regard one action as governance.  But one does regard many arranged actions 
intended toward one purpose [as governance].  This is similar to the matter 
of the governance of states and wars.  Therefore one may say regarding 
G-d that he is the governer of the world, for in the eye of the masses, 
it is similar to the governance of the state.  But according to philosopy 
[the word's use] is homylitic.  So far are his words regarding the governance 
of the individual; understand it.</P>
<P>	And by his saying, " it is permissible that He should impose upon us 
impossible things(p467)" he means after He has ordained the changing of 
destiny.  "And it is likewise permissible that, having obeyed his order, 
we should be punished; and that, having transgressed it, we should be rewarded" 
 After he punishes and rewards for the destined to occur and the destined 
not to occur.</P>
