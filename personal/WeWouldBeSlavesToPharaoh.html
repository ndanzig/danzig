 <h2>We Would Be Slaves To Pharaoh in Egypt</h2>

<p>0. The simple meaning of this statement is that the Egyptian empire would 
never have ended and we ould still be slaves there. This  is hard to 
believe.  Would history really have stood still?  Wouldn't Egypt eventually 
have ceased to be an empire?  Empires come and go.  So had G-d not taken us 
out, we would be free in some other way.  The tower of Babel teaches us that 
every empire will eventually
come to internal fracture and crumble away, even if no outside force 
destroys it.
This was implanted into the nature of empires by G-d at that juncture. 
 So Egypt would surley have ended at some time.

<p>1. On the simplest level this statement should be understood as a statement of
out mental attitude.  We should try to imagine that we might still be slaves 
in Egypt.  And then imagine that our children and grandchildren would be
 there too.  And from thinking of how terrible this all is and then realizing
 that G-d brought us out, we are the more grateful to Him and will praise Him
 with real feeling and conviction.  So this is a mental exercise using the
 imagination.  It is an duty for us to go through these steps in our 
imagination so we can praise G-d truly.

<p>2.  On another level it should be understood as a statement of a certain 
transformation which occured in the Jewish people that made us perminently 
free people. Being "meshuabad" means to be subserviant to another people.  
Most ancient people have died out over the years.  Where are the Visigoths?
  The Huns?  The Medes?  They were either wiped out or absorbed into another 
people.  The Jews have suffered the same circumstances as these people, yet 
we have not died out.
We have suffer persecution and subjugation.  We have faced assimilation, 
but where other nations have disolved in these circumstances, we have 
survived.  In part this is because we have identity re-inforcing holidays
 like Passover to remind us of who we are.
But also there is a miraculous character to our survival.  G-d has caused
 this.  By taking us out of Egypt He made us a free people.  So we can never
 truly by subjugated.  No matter what we suffer we will remain inwardly free.
  Anything that G-d does is permanent, so our freedom is permanent since he took us out of egypte, (He and no angel).  The third temple will be permanent becasue
He will build it.
This is the meaning of the statement that had G-d not taken us out of Egypt
 we would still be slaves in Egypt.
The meaning is that we would have eventually fallen prey to some "shiabud"
 and either be wiped out or assimilated into another nation.  So we would 
today be slaves to some forein culture and not even realize we were truly
 Jews.
We would be slaves to some "Egypt" and we would think we were free.  True
 freedom is being who you really are.  Expressing your soul's desires.  
That would have been lost to us through history's inevitable pressures. 
 But G-d took us out and made us free today. WHo is free? He who Keeps the
 Torah. 

So we can thank G-d today that we are able to be here now celebrating
 Passover and not part of some other nation.
