One of the central words of the parsha is zva.  G-d command moshe to count
all the males over age 20 who may go out "zva". Rashi is quoted by the Ramban
 as saying that yotzeh zva means those who can go to war. But the Ramban
 suggests  an alternate meaning: those who go out to join the community, 
kehila. How does this meaning fit to the word zva?
<p>
The primary need of man is to be social.  As aristotle says, man is the
 political
animal. Since man  cannot survive alone, he must form groups. 
 And these groups must be governed, ordered or at least follow some rules.
So man is an animal requiring political structures. Man makes communities.
 An army is an occasional function of the community. You certainly cannot have
an army with out people first joining togetehr in some sort of politcal 
fashion.
<p>
In english translations of the Homer you will see the word Host used to apply
to an enemy army.  But a Host in also a joining of people.  To host some one 
is to bring him into your community.  The word retains this double meaning,
 community and the army of the community.  The army is just one type of coming
together of a people to form a community. 

<p>If you look at the word "zva" it is composed of two word ze and ba.  
"go out" and "come in"  An army is on the one hand a coming in together of
 people for a unifying purpose.
But it is for the purpose of going out to meet the enemy in the field.  
All actions of a kehila, community are first coming togethers and then doing 
some action, going out, together. Thus zva can mean army or community of any type.

<p>
In this sense Moshe is counting the Jewish poeple.  G-d is about to set the 
schina down on the community. God will settle only on a people that has first
 come together as a community. Thus the counting.  Each person must give his
 half shekel and join the community. Especially for a holy structure like a 
mishkan, the community must be united, not for violence, but for Godliness.
