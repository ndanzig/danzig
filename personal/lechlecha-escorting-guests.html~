<h3>Lech Lecha and Escorting Guests </h3>
<p>
See verse Bereshit 12:20 <br>
A loose translation:  And Pharaoh organized an envoy of people and sent them 
with  (Abraham) and his wife and all their belongings.  
<p>
See Babylonian Talmud Sota 46b
<br>
A loose translation:  "And Pharaoh organized a envoy of people and sent them with him."
Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi said, on account of the four steps Pharaoh walked in escorting Abraham home, Abraham's
children were enslaved for 400 years, as is written, "And they shall serve 
them for 400 years." 
<p>
See Torah Temimah on Gen. 12:20 <br>
He explains that Rabbi Levi does not mean that the enslavement came as a
result of Abraham's accepting Pharaoh's
escort.  This is not a sin. And in any event the reason for the enslavement
is for other reasons as explained in verse 14:14.  Rather, Rabbi Levi
means to explain by what merit Pharaoh came to be the one to enslave 
the Israelites and not some other king.
It is by the merit of his escorting. Furthermore, since escorting is a minimum
 of
4 cubits, it can be assumed that Pharaoh escorted at least 
that amount.  This is the reason for the choice of the number
400 years for the slavery to last.  This also teaches that escorting may be 
done
by appointed agents instead of by  ones own person since this is what Pharaoh
 did and
his escorting is considered valid.



<p>
Pharaoh was the first to escort a guest.
However, Abraham established the practice of hospitality in the Israelite 
religion.
It appears from the above rabbinic source that he did not invent
the concept. He
learned it from Pharaoh.
<p>
Rambam considers escorting the highest form of generosity. It is not on the
same level as all the other many types of <i>hesed</i>.  
<br>
See Yad: Shoftim: Hilchol Avel : 14:1-3.
<br>
A loose translation: 
<ol>
<li> <p>It is a positive rabbinic commandment to visit the sick, to comfort mourners,
 to attend funerals, to help arrange weddings, to escort visitors, to help bury
the dead, to carry the dead to the cemetary, to walk in the funeral 
processional, to eulogize, to dig the grave, to fill in the grave, to delight
the bride and groom and to help them with all their needs.  These are commandments
of generosity that one must fulfill with his person.  There is no limit
to how much a person may engage in them.
<p>Even though all these commandments are rabbinic, they also fulfill the
Torah commandment of "Love your neighbour as yourself" which is interpretted
to mean 'anything that you would like others to do for you, do it for 
your brother in Torah and commandments.' 
</li>
<li>
<p>The reward for escorting guests is the greatest of all the rewards for the
 above acts. It is
the law that Abraham our father decreed. He lived by this way of generosity.
He would feed travelers and give them drink.  He would escort them on their
way.  Hosting guests is a more important activity than even receiving
Divine communication, as is written, "And (Abraham) looked and behold there 
were three people.(Gen 18:2)" Escorting guests is more important than 
giving them a place to rest.  The sages have said "Who soever does not escort 
travelers is as one who murders them."
</li>
<li><p>
The community must force people to escort travelers in the same way that they
must force people to give charity. The Jewish courts used to arrange guards
to escort people who passed from place to place.  And if they were lazy in 
this matter it was considered as if they were murderers.  Even one who 
escorts his friend four cubits receives great reward.  
<p>What is the minimum amount a person must escort? A Rabbi must escort his
student to the edge of the town. A person must escort his friend to the
edge of the shabbat tehum (2000 cubits from the last house in the town).
A student must escort his Rabbi for a mile outside of the town. If it is his
principal Rabbi, he must escort him 3 miles.  
</li>
</ol>


<p>
This important mitzvah is often neglected.  If we consider that escorting was
 for the protection of the guest we may think that today times are safe enough
and police are protection enough that we may be exempt from this <i>mitzvah</i>.
Conversely, today times are very dangerous for Jews, especially when traveling
through foreign lands.  This mitzvah is given a great reward because 
not only is it important to protect people, but because it is easy to
avoid this mitzvah, to shirk ones responsibilty.  No one 
will ever know if you did not escort some traveler.  It is therefore the 
tendancy of people to avoid this mitzvah and come up with 
various reasons why it is not their responsibility.  Therefore, the Rambam
writes that the entire community must get involved as a whole, and with no
exceptions.  If left to the individual, no one would do it.

<p>Hosting people is equally difficult for people.  Often the thought 
crosses the mind of the potential host, "Why does he come to me, there are plenty of hotels." This is a legitimate argument.  All the more reason to praise
someone who generously does open his house to a stranger.  The person
maybe should not be asking you for a place to stay, but that
doesn't mean you don't have to give him a place to stay.  Remember
Sadom and Gemorrah were destroyed because they did not offer hospitality.
The concubine at Givah was killed because the townfolk would not
give her and her husband a place to sleep. 
<p> It may be argued 
that now-a-days strangers may be very dangerous.  But, it is likely they were 
just as dangerous in the times of the Rabbis.  In fact, if a stranger
seems to be dangerous then one should not invite him.  But often the stranger 
is not dangerous.  He's just strange.  And when someone lets a strange person 
into his house it is true kindness.  G-d will reward the host
by letting him into His house, even though he has made himself strange to G-d
by
his transgressions.

<p>
I heard from Rav Fixler of Shadmot Mecholah what he heard from a classmate
from Yeshivat Kfar Etzion back in his day.

<p>There are a number of linguistic parallels between the story of Lech Lecha 
and Gan Eden.Sara did not have her edna a word based on Eden. On one level the Garden of Eden story describes teh break down of husband and wife relations.
We are meant to get back to that state. Abraham stood under the "tree" etz.  
the word etz apears twice in the story , for no apparent reason. It remionds us of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
When man sinned the way back was guarded , Abraham was expected to follow teh 
way of g-d , to do justice and mercy.  this is the way back to the correct 
human relationship.Eve gave amn the fruit in an act of selfishness, as teh
rtabbis tell us, so when she died he would not marry another.   The correct relationship 
is one of selflessness, doing for th eother.  

the tree of knowledge relates to the biblical sense of knowing a woman.
it is the way to connect to another person.
