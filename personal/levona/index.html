Levona: What hospital do cat go to to give birth in?
<br />Hadas M.:No, cats don't go to hospitals. They go to veterinarys.

Kindergarten Teacher: And G-d gave the Land of Canaan to Abraham as a beutiful present. <br />
Levona: (Thinks...) That was a heavy present for him to get.

After Teacher hands out a variety of paper butterfly cut-outs and asks each
student to put one on the board.  Levona put up all three varieties.
<br />Kindergarten Teacher:  Levona, I asked everyone put up just one butterfly.
<br />Levona: But I did. One big butterfly, one medium-size butterfly, and one small butterfly.

rashaim.  All the police are rashaim.

<br />I was babysitting the children and Levona asked me to read 
them a story at bedtime. I told them I had better read to them in Hebrew since 
I don't read Dutch so well.  Hadass Moriah (or Levona)  told me,
<br> 'You can read a Dutch
book since Dutch is not so different from English.' So I began to read a 
Dutch fairytale book. After some time I ask if they understood.  Levona
said 'I don't understand many things but I can understand because 
the Englsih you are 
reading is very similar to Dutch!' She went on 'That word you just said 
is the same in Dutch.' March 2006
