<p> Oedipus Rex was the son of the King of Thebes. The Oracle of Delphi 
told the king that his son would kill him and marry his wife.
To prevent this prophecy from taking place, the king decided
to maim his son and leave him on  a mountain top to die.
But an old shepherd found him and Oedipus eventually came to be raised 
by the King of Corinth.  When Oedipus visits Delphi, the oracle tells him the prophecy
  that he will kill his father and marry his
 mother. Oedipus  decides 
to leave Corinth. He makes his way back to Thebes, not knowing it is his birthplace. 
He meets and kills the King of Thebes, not knowing that the king is his father. 
By solving the riddle of the Sphinx, Oedipus is enabled to marry the queen, again, not knowing 
it is his mother.  When he finds out his true identity he blinds himself and his mother kills herself.

<p>
The story of Joseph and his brothers is remarkably similar to the one of Oedipus.
Joseph also receives a prophecy (two times in fact) that he is destined to rule over his brothers.
(Oedipus also ruled over his brothers and family). The Rabbis point out that
Joseph's mother could not bow down to him since she was dead.  Thus the mother 
is not strictly part of the prophecy of Joseph being a ruler over them. This may be either 
a parallel to Oedipus's mother who also was not Oedipus's subject or in an attempt to 
remove the mother from the story all together and thereby expurgate the 
incestuous part of the Oedipus story from
the Joseph story.
Notwithstanding, Joseph is in fact  subjected to sexual harassment and potential adultery
at the hands of   an ( older )
woman, Potifar's wife. This does parallel Oedipus's encounter with his own mother.
No other positive figure in the Bible comes close to sleeping with another older man's wife.
Joseph's refusal parallels Oedipus's disgust when he discovers what happened.




<p>
Attempting to prevent the prophecy, the brothers had
left Joseph to die in a pit. After that  his ownership was transferred several times
such that no one knew anymore who Joseph was.
This device eventually was the cause of the prophecy's fulfillment.

Had he not been left to die and sold into slavery he never would have become King of Egypt.  
So too, Oedipus's and his father's  attempt to circumvent the oracle's prophecy in fact lead to its fulfillment.
By explaining the puzzling dream of the Pharaoh, Joseph finally becomes ruler, just as the prophecy declared.
But no one (except him) know what his origins are. Just as Oedipus' confused or unknown 
linage made the events of his story possible, Joseph uses his anonymity to bring about the final fulfillment of the
prophecy by bringing his brothers, all his brothers, before him to bow down.




<p> So what we have in common is:
<UL>
<li> Prophecy of Usurping
<li> Repetition of the prophecy
<li> Attempt Murder to prevent prophecy
<li> Multiple Transferal of guardianship over the hero
<li> Sexual indiscretion (adultery ) with an older woman
<li> Rise to power by solving riddle/puzzling dream
<li> Theme that attempting to avoid fate brings fate about

</ul>

<p> But what differs is equally interesting.  What is most strikingly different is the ending.
The Joesph story is fundamentally optimistic.  The prophecy is fulfilled in a good way.
Everyone survives the famine. The Israelites get a good place to live and the  Egyptian monarchy gets wealthy.
In contrast, Oedipus is left to wander the country-side blind and miserable. The Jewish G-d is kind and just;
the Greek gods are cruel and whimsical.


<p> Another contrast is the role that Joseph plays.  Joseph's own actions are also crucial in bringing
 about the fulfillment of the prophecy, 
despite his assertion to the contrary.  He made the plan to store food; he forced all his family to come
 before him and bow.
Oedipus is totally oblivious to what he is doing.  Even before he blinds himself, he progresses through life blind
to what is really going on.  He is oblivious to the true meaning of his actions until the end when 
it is to late to fix things.

Thus, Oedipus is really a helpless victim of fate but Joseph is an actor in his own fate,
 taking a part in his own destiny.
<p>
This is another Biblical theme, that man can control his fate and affect the world and create positive or 
potentially negative results.
Man is a partner with G-d in history. In this sense man acts with G-d or even in the the role of G-d, as the 
orchestrator of events.  Joseph  relishes this role. He orchestrates a complex scheme to test his brothers and 
fulfill the prophecy that all of them should bow down to him. Even his first words to Pharaoh hint that he 
sees himself acting in G-d's place.
"It is for G-d to interpret dreams." (Gen. 41:16) Whereupon Joseph  proceeds to interpret the dream.

And again later he attributes his actions of saving mankind from famine to G-d, thus completing the identification:
 "G-d has sent me ahead of you to insure that you survive in the land and to keep you alive through extraordinary 
means." (Gen. 45:7)

And later  (Gen 50:19) , consoling his brothers Joeseph says rhetorically, "Am I in G-d's stead?"
  But we could also read the verse as,  "I am in G-d's place."

Further more, verses 42:7-9 uses repetitive short verbs about Joseph recognizing the brothers and remembering the prophecy.
Compare the similar verbal constructs attributed to G-d in Shmot 2:24-25.

<p>
The act of interpreting dreams is also an opportunity to take hold of events and affect them.
Interpreting a dream allows one to give a positive (or negative) meaning to something which 
could go either way and this act then
puts man in a position of power over destiny.
When Joseph takes the two seemingly similar dreams, the one  of the wine steward and the other of the  baker
he gives one dream  a positive interpretation and the other a negative interpretation. The events that the follow are
actually constrained to accord with these interpretations and thus Joseph is indicating that man can control fate.
So too Pharaoh's dream seems very negative and ominous, but Joseph turns it into
a positive message, one that can bring Pharaoh all of Egypt's wealth.  We see no similar power over destiny in Oedipus. 

<p>Joseph sees himself as acting in G-d's place, controlling history.  This is an important lesson for mankind.
There are people today who justify careless exposure to hazard with the explanation that man is 
preordained to die on a specific day.  Once an Arab child ran across a busy highway.  When questioned, his father 
said he should not scold the child since it is his fate to die or not to die.
The Oedipus story is about the unavoidable nature of fate.  Joseph's is about man's free will intertwining
in fate to create positive or negative consequences, depending on man's actions.
The Bible here asserts that  misfortune comes as a consequence of human action, and is not merely the whim
of G-d, as the brothers state so clearly,  
"We deserve to be punished because of what we did to our brother. We saw him suffering when he 
pleaded with us, but we would not listen. <em>That's why this great misfortune has come upon us now</em>."
(Gen. 42:21)
