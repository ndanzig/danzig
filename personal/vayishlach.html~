<h2>Parshat VaYishlach</h2>

<p>
The parsha starts of with Yaaov sending "malachim" to Esav his brother.
Rashi comments that these were "mamash" (real) "malachim".  The word malachim
has two meanings. One is a messenger and the other is an angel.  So when Rashi
says that they were real malachim does he mean real messengers or real angels?
Telling me that an ambiguous word really means what it means does not help me
unless I believe that one meaning is more primary.  

<p> Most readers assume that Rashi means really Angels.  They think this becasue they
assume that the real or primary  meaning of malachim is angel.  They think
that the noraml word for messenger is shluchim.  But this is not so.  the word shluchim does not appear in the Torah as a noun.  And in fact malachim's primary meaning is messenger, hence there are expressions like malachi hashem, messengers of G-d . that could not mean angels of G-d since obviously all angels are from G-d.
 The primary meaning is messenger and this then takes on the meaning Angel when those messengers are sent by G-d.


<p> If we read the end of the previous parsha we will understand
why Rashi makes his comment.
There Yaacov fights with an ANgel called Pniel.  So when our parsha begins we might think that yaacov is sending Angels , just like the ones he fought, so rashi tells us no these are real re, so Rashi lJtatwrestles
