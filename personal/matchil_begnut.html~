<blockquote>
Talmud Bavli, Mesechet Pesachim Daf 116a
"'One must start with disgrace and end with praise': What is 'with disgrace'?
Rav says, 'In the beginning our forefathers were idol worshippers...' And 
Shmuel says, 'We were slaves ...' "

<p>
The above law and dispute has been understood <a href=#1><sup>1</sup></a> to
be based on the 
principle that one must first show his low state so that he can then 
paint his ensuing salvation is stark contrast.  The salvation is better
appreciated if one understands the prior degradation.  Then the disagreement 
between Rav and Shmuel is understood to be  about what was the greater or true
degradation of the Isralites, a spiritual one (being idolators) or physical one
(being enslaved). And so too what was
the essence of their redemption.  More generally, is man's spiritual liberation
more or less important than his physical one?<a href=#2><sup>2</sup></a> 

<p>
While this explanation is poetic and moving one may wonder, Surely both
degradations are equally significant?  Can't Rav and Shmuel agree to that?
Can't we discuss both issues in the Haggaddah?  Why the argument?

<p>
On a practical and more basic level the dipute is also a dispute as to 
where to start the story of the Exodus.  Do we start with Terach the idoloator
as Rav says or do we start the story with the suffering Israelites in Egypt, 
400 years later? The question is, When does this narrative begin?
In 1969  William Buckley, Jr. debated Professor 
Noam Chomsky on the moral basis of the Vietnam war.<a href=#3><sup>3</sup>
</a> At one point in the 
debate, Buckley tells Chomsky that he is choosing where to start the story 
of American intervention for his own purposes and by so doing determining
its moral validity. "You start you line of discussion at a moment that is 
historically useful for you."<a href=#4><sup>4</sup></a>
If the discussion starts with North Vietnamese terrorist infiltration 
into the South in 1959, then US military support of the South is justified, 
but if it starts earlier, in 1956, with the South's comando invasion of the 
North,  then US intervention on behalf of the South seems less
 justified.  (In the end, I think Chomsky won the debate.)
Where we start a story often changes our moral assessment of the players.
In a similar way, where we start the Exodus story changes
its ethical implications.


<p> Rav feels the story should begin with Terach the idolator.
That is the beginning of G-d's intervention, the beginning of His 
choosing to have a special relationship with the Jewish people. In fact,
the Jewish people did not yet exist.  They were destined to come from Terach's
son Abraham.  What was the nature of G-d choice?  Rav U. Milevsky, z"l says 
that for a choice to really be a choice, there must be no obvious distinction
between the things being chosen.  When a students gets all the answers 
right on a test, we don't say that the teacher <i>chose</i> to give the student
an A, the student earned an A. For G-d's choice of the Jewish people to really
be a choice, then there must have been no reason for the choice, the Jewish 
people must have been no different from any other.  To emphasize this 
point, Rav says G-d chose the Jewish people well before they even existed.
And the progenator was no better than anyone else, Terach was an idolator just 
like everyone else, yet G-d chose his descendents to represent Truth to the
world.  Thus, G-d entered into a particular relationship with the Jews which
no other nation can have.  It is an unconditional relationship, since it was
not based on any particular merit.  It is akin to the relationship 
between a father and a son.  The father loves and protects his son not because
of anything the son has done to earn that love, it is an unconditional
love.  For Rav, G-d's relation to the Jewish people is highly particularistic.
No other nation has or can have such a close relationship.

<p>
Shmuel says the story of G-d's redemption should start with our suffering at
the hands of the Egyptians.  This implies that G-d chose to help us 
because we were suffering.  This is then  a choice to help based on 
circumstances.  Had another nation been enslaved, G-d would have saved them.
Thus the story of redemption has a universal nature.  All oppressed 
people can seek reasurance from this story.  G-d is the saviour of the 
oppressed. Significantly, by starting the story in Egypt, Shmuel skips 
the pact between Abraham and G-d, the Brit Bein HaBetarim, which arguably
was the primary reasons for G-d's intervention, G-d's promise to Abraham.
But Shmuel intentionally skips this part of the story.  Shmuel wants to 
emphasize the universal element of the story.  It is a story of G-d saving 
the oppressed.

<p> We can learn from this what is G-d's relatioinship to the Jewish people.
Rav says He loves us no matter what, like a father loves his child.  "My
country right or wrong."  G-d protects us because we are His people, we 
represent Him in the world and so He cannot let us suffer or die out, that
would disgrace His Name, h"v. Shmuel says, No, G-d's love and protection of
us stems from His basic nature of being merciful and protective of
all mankind. He loves us because we deserve his love by our ethical 
behaviour or at least because we are human beings.

<p>These two concepts conflict within each and every one of us. 
We are loyal to and love our family members, and we also have a commitment 
to justice.  What do you do if  your brother commits a terrible crime?
Does your sense of justice make you report him, or does
your loyalty make you protect him.  This difficult 
conflict is respected by civil law.  A spouse cannot be made to testify 
against his or her spouse.  That moral dilema has not been solved, so the
law provides a way out.
Plato also discusses this conflict in the Euthyphro, where a son 
reports his father for accidently killing his slave.
This conflict is also reflected in current Israeli politics.  Some Israelis
place their love of their fellow Jews higher than their sense of justice 
while others value justice above and beyond any familial loyalty.


<p>Where does the Haggadah actually start?  After some lengthy preliminary 
discussions about the importance of telling the story, and examples of 
Rabbis who told the story late into the night,  the Haggadah actually
starts the story with the story of Terach, "Arami Oved Avi..." which
in drash is understood as referring
 to Terach. 

The Haggadah poskins like Rav.  
It is a falicy to claim both opinions are 
fulfilled. Shmuel says <b>don't</b> discuss anything before Egyptian bondage,
but the Haggadah starts 400 years before that with "Arami Oved Avi."
If one says start at point A and the other says start at point C,
you can't claim that by starting at point A you are fulfilling both opinions!
What does this mean?  It means that the Haggadah believes the story of G-d's 
redemption should be understood in a particularistic light. G-d's love for the
Jews is as inexplicable as a father's love for his son. G-d chose us 
and once that choice has been made He has a special relationship 
to us.  He is our protector and we are His representatives in this world.
Pesach celebrates G-d's love for us.
If we extend this to human psychology in general, it 
means that the Haggadah feels that man's primary loyalty is for his
family and not for abstract concepts of justice.  This is an important 
lesson of the Haggadah.
<hr>
My friend Avi Wollman points out that really these two different G-d
to man relationships exist simultaneously. Most of the year and in general
G-d guards Israel if Israel deserves it, but on Pesach, when even the Rasha
joins the meal, G-d's underlying irrevocable love for Israel takes over.
A father's unconditional love for his child can lead  the child to 
do irresponsible things, knowing his father will be there for him in any event.
So in general a father must make his son realize
that the father's protection will be based on his behavior.  But once a year the father needs
to tell his son that really, no matter what the son does, the father will be there for him.
That day is Pesach.
