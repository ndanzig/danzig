<h2>Excerpts from <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i></h2>
<ul>
<li>Quoting Nietzsche "He who has a <i>why</i> to live for can bear with almost any <i>how</i>" p. 121, 164 (Pocket Books Simon and Schuster 1963) 
<li>Quoting Nietzsche "Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich starker." (That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.) p. 130
<li>What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you. 
Not only our
experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had, 
and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have 
brought it into being.  Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the
 surest kind. p 131
<li>At the beginning of human history, man lost some of the basic animal 
instincts in which an animal's behavior is embedded and by which it is secured.
Such security, like Paradise, is closed to man forever; man has to make choices. p. 168

<li>Quoting schopenhauer :  mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate 
eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom. p. 169
<li>we can discover meaning in life in three different ways: by doing a deed; 
by experiencing  a value; and by suffering. p. 176 
<li> I observed that procreation is not  the only meaning of life, for then 
life in itself would become meaningless, and something that in itself is 
meaningless cannot be rendered meaningful merely by its perpetuation. p.189
<li>For, in the past, nothing is irrecoverably lost but everything is 
irrevocably stored. p. 191

<li>At any moment, man must decide, for better or for worse, what will be 
the monument of his existence. p. 191
<li>Ha he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic 
over his own lost youth? What reason has he to envy a young person? For the
possibilities that a young person has, the future that is in store for him?
"No, thank you," he will think. "Instead of possibilities, I have realities in
my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of suffering
bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most
proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy." p. 192- 193
<li>Anticipatory anxiety must be counteracted by paradoxical intention;
 hyperintention as well as hyper-reflection must be counteracted by 
de-reflection; de-reflection, however, ultimately is not possible except by
 the patient's reorientation toward his specific vocation and mission in 
life. p. 294
