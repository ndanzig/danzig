<h2> Rosh HaShana</h2>
<p>
First Mishna of chapter 3 of Rosh Hashan seems to be out of place since 
it speaks of the am yisrael and the whole beit din seeing the new moon and 
yet not having time to consecrate it, whereas the rest of the chapter deals
with blowing shofar and other Rosh Hashana activities.

<p> Answer may be this: When does all am yisrael try to see the new moon? 
When they need to know whether it is Rosh Hashana or not. So point of fact, 
the mishna is speaking about Rosh Hashana, not rosh hodesh.  The activity
 of Rosh Hashana 
evening is for father and son to look for the moon so as to know if today 
is Rosh HaShana or not.

<p>In the Yerushalmi Rosh Hashana chapter 1:3 is written a long piece of
 agada concerning eee im


<p>
On Rosh Hashan we have three prayers in the shmoneh esrai, malchiot, 
shofrot and zichronot. We crown G-d King, we ask him to remember us for good
and we do it with a shofar.
Mishna in Taanit (2:2) describes that when troubles occur to Israel,
we fast and add 6 extra tefillot to the shmoneh esrei. Among those we
add (mishna 2:3) are Zichronot and Shofrot, but not malchiot. Why not?
<p>
As parents when our child does something wrong that cannot be ignored,
two things can happen: either he comes to us and admits he did something 
wrong, or we seek him out. Generally the first does not happen and we need
 to seek him out.  And it is a pity because had he come to us the punishment
 would have been less, because he is admitting. 
<p>
In the same way, there are two ways G-d can relate to us. Either he can
 bring on us hardships and then we turn to Him to save us, or 
we of our own volition can come to him and ask him to judge us.
That is why on fast days we do not say malchiot because the hardship we
are facing means G-d has sought us out and is judging us.  We can
only ask for mercy, i.e. shofrot and zichronot.

<p>But on Rosh Hashana we are coming to him, making him king and asking us to judge us, and asking for mercy.
