<h3> To Sit and Learn or to Earn a Living</h3>
<p>
In the Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Talmud Torah, chapter three, Rambam describes that
 G-d gave the Jewish people three crowns.  Here are his words:
<blockquote>
"With three crowns was Israel crowned: the crown of Torah, the crown of 
priesthood and the crown of kingship."
</blockquote>

The three crowns of the Rambam are also represented in the Temple.
Which three vessels in the Temple are described as having a golden crown  
"zer zahav saviv" ?
1. The table (shulchan) which provides food and sustenance and therefore 
represents kingship (malchut).
2. The golden alter (mizbeach hazahav) which obviously represents priesthood (kahuna).
3. The ark (aron) also has a golden crown around it and the ark contains the tablets of
the covenant and a Torah scroll and so represents Torah.
<p>
But there is a fourth vessel in the Temple, the Menorah.  It  is also a symbol
 of Torah; in medrashim we have a double symbolism for Torah.
Why does the Menorah have no "zer"? It represents a crownless Torah.
The Sfat Emet explains this in the following way. He asks,  why is there no
altar (misbeach) in the Holy of Holies (Kodesh Kadoshim)?  Why is the ark all alone
 while the Menorah shares its space  with the mizbeach and the shulchan?
<p>
He aswers that the  Menorah with its seven branches represents the seven 
branches of wisdom (chochma).  The seven sources of chachma are used in Torah study.
And the mizbeach in the middle reminds one that (while one can learn Torah not 
for its own sake (leshma) but for personal enjoyment or for honor) one should learn
Torah for its own sake or for the  sake of heaven, or in other words  
for the sake of the altar which represents man's connection to G-d, the priesthood.
So too the physical world (as represented by the table containing bread) should
also be for the  sake of heaven (leshem shamayim). And so both the Menorah and the 
table need to be in the proximity of the altar.  They need to be for the sake of 
something else.
<p>
But, in the Holy of Holies there is no altar because on that high level there is 
no concept of acting leshem shamayim or not.  Acting leshem shamayim only applies when
one is far from ones goal. Then, one must ask am I doing this for the right goal or the
wrong goal.  But if my action are at the highest level, then I am at the goal so I am 
not concerned with my motivations. The ark represents Torah at the highest level, at 
a level united with G-d.  Moses (Moshe) was at this level. He was connected to G-d 
so much that he was beyond leshem shamayim.  He had lost his ego and so could
not even ask am "I" doing this for the right reason. He had no self concern.
He had united himself to G-d (davuk bashem).  This is the meaning of humility of Moshe.
He did not focus on himself, even though he knew he was great. Thus Moshe could 
prophesy while awake.  Generally one had to loose awareness of oneself to prophesy.
Most people can do that only while asleep.  Moshe was like that even awake. So he 
could prophesy while awake. He was having devekut with Hashem. So one even can't ask
is Moshe acting leshem shamayim; he is one with Hashem, devekut. The level of Moshe is
also beyond chochma.  His learning of Torah is direct and clear.
<p>
So, the Menorah represents Torah, but it it the Torah of the Jew who learns 
leshem shamayim. He uses chochma to learn Torah and keeps his eye on the mizbeach.
 But he is not truly immersed in Torah, so he must share the room with the table
 and the altar.
The ark also represents Torah. But it represents the Jew immersed in Torah. 
At this high level there is no need for the symbolism of the altar.
This is the "Crown of Torah",  thus the Rambam's words at the end of the Laws of Shmitot and 
Jubilees describing the Torah Jew as Holy of the Holies (kodesh kodashim)
refer to not the Menorah Jew but the ark Jew since the ark is in the Holy of Holies.
This is  the Crown of Torah. The Crown of the Torah may mean it authority (koach),
 in which case Torah authority is only given to the ark Jew.  And this Jew is allowed
to throw of the yoke of earning a livelihood.    
<p>
But many have pointed out that only a sage such as Shimon bar Yocha is on this level 
but not us. We must follow the teaching of Rabbi Yishmoel that we must work and learn
 Torah.  But we see there is the concept of some people just learning and it is part 
of the Jewish system (even if not strictly applicable today). For more about Shimon 
bar Yochai see Nefesh HaHayim. There it is discussed that the Torah verses in the shm'a
 which discuss the blessing of working (asafta deganecha) a seeming contradiction the Rabbis Shimon's ideal of only learning Torah.  He quotes Rabbi Shimon's explanation
that this section refer to one who is not doing G-d's will 
(enan osim razon shel makom).
The Nefesh HaHayim notes that the first section (parsha) of shm'a is in the singular.
 The second 
section is almost entirely in the plural. In the first parsha there is no discussion 
of doing mitzvot (kabalat miztvah), just a general acceptance of G-d authority 
(kabbalat ol). The second parsha has the discussing of working. The second parsha also
 has the threat if one doesn't listen.  The first parsha require a triple level of
commitment, "all your heart, soul and might"  second only discusses "heart and soul" 
but no "might".  Haym Veloshiner, explains that the first parsha is the ark Jew: Shimon
 bar Yochai.  He serves with the third element, his might (maodecha) explained to mean 
with his money.  I.e. he has given up entirely on money.  Money means nothing to him.
<p>
But second parsha is the regular Jew. He keeps his money.  Also, the second
parsha describes the Jew who does mitzvahs. The first parsha is beyond mitzvoth,
 it is ol malchut. Like Rabbi Shimon holds (according to the Ohr  Somayach ) that
one who learns all day doesn't need to wear tefilin because he is already immersed 
in Torah. Not because of the general rule of  "osek bemitzvah patur min hamitzvah", 
but that learning is the fulfillment (kiyum) of the mitzvah.  Like Ben Azai's answer to
the why he had no children.  Immersion in Torah is the fulfillment of having children.
<p>
So, the second parsha is ein osim razon shel makom.  But the ark Jew is
 razon shel makom.  But  the masses of Jews must live as the menorah Jew 
(hence the plural in second parsha).  By all the vessels it says "You (singular) should
 make" (veasitah), but by the ark it says "You (plural) shall make" (veasu).
This hints that the ark Jew has to be relies on the people. He needs public support.
<p>
Rav Aron Kutler says the permission to accept money today for Torah learning is 
based on the Shach, "Et Lasot".  This idea can be traced back to the persian exile 
when the Jews were heavily influenced by Persian ways and the Anshe Kannesset Hagadola
said as quoted in Pirke Avot "Hamidu talmidim harbeh."  We may ask, what is the hidush?
Normally we would prefer getting only the best students, hamidu talmidim tovim.
But when people have forgotten Torah, after the Persian exile, we first need to 
build up the numbers.  Then later we can be more exclusive.
