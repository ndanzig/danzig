Interesting things in parsha

End of ki tisa 34:34  mask of moshe . 

2. ohel moed versus mishkan, moshe's tent is also called ohel moed, but so is inner part of mishkan.


This parsha 
Start with 
shabbat
and the killing for burning fire on shabbat
Rashi says this teaches not to do work of mishkan on shabbat.


But Kit tisa
pervious parsha ch. 31 verse 13 ach et shabbtotai tishmoru - rashi says teaches that act of work of mishkan must
be stopped on shabbat, teache 39 malachot

Why two source?  Talmud in Shabbat 71 learns for this parsha , not ki tisa

Ki tisa is god-> moshe
Vayakel is Moshe to people.

Should not we learn from  the place where the Law is originally taught by God?
But not, torah is man's torah, so we learn the oral law from the place where moshe our teacher tells us.  this put man in the center of the law.
