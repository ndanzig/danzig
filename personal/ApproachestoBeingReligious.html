<h2>Approaches to Becoming Religiously Observant - Summer 1988 </h2>
<ol>
<li> Torat Emet - the Torah is logical
	<ol type=a>
	<li> Attack Conservatives
	<li> We need to do what is right- a person naturally wants to do what is right</ol>
<li> Torat Haim - Beautiful life style
<ol type=a>
	<li> Say lets go further than Conservatives, more love for G-d
	<li> It is a way toward self-knowledg, philosophic ideas</ol>

<li>Bracha 
<ol type=a>
    <li>Give the person a peer group, support from frum people
	 <li>Torah is pleasurable, yom tov, shabbos, Tische
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
Act as if you love someone - to gain love
<br>Becoming Religious is like marrying G-d- don't just hope she's right, examine her and see if she seems good,
then marry her - but you still aren't sure , only maybe 98% sure, that is Emuna.
<p>
If the Commands are made up, people in the past wouldn't have accepted some laws which are senseless., shmita, kashrus.
<p>
If you go to tribes to sell them the stories - they wouldn't accept it either because it criticises their ancestors,  Yehuda nad Levy for example. Killed  
(or tried to) Joseph. Even Moshes - the ideal man- was
without faith in G-d - He hit the stone to get water. The writers would not be looking to insert flaws in the main 
characters.
<p>

Historical psychological genious(hidden codes) proofs.
<br>
We ask questions , we look for contradictions , and we find answers
If the book were flawed, we'd destroy the Torah - it would fall apart - it would be answerless.
Book is so full of moral ideas- it establishes an absolute moral. 
Movements like Communism try to make the 
world a better place, Judaism says , start by self help, make people better.  That will fix the world.
Equality - people do share some traits, we are all in image of G-d, we all have free choice. 
<p>
Why not just be a good person? What is good? You need a moral system for evaluating behaviour- not just doing good.
Should man or G-d decide good vs. evil- Man determines good by his current mind set/behaviour.
Behaviour is the determinate - not the moral which follows the behaviour. Morality vs. self interest.
Everything is good if good is what I am doing or What is generally done  or what you are doing.
<p>
Jewish good leads to greater life, achieving a meaningful life (In the western world that is just being a financial success).
