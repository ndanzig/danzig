<P ALIGN="LEFT">You're not gonna want to miss this one!</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">So, first things first, our Tiyul. To be honest, I've never had a better, well thought-out and organized trip. The day started with a trip to Kever Rachel where we discussed different aspects of her spiritual qualities and achievements that moved us into deep emotional prayer at her grave. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&#9;Next stop was Hevron; what more can be said about such a place of religious controversy. I mean, our forefathers/mothers are buried there, yet Jewish people are limited in their access to prayer there. I found that very disturbing; what can you do but pray? </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&#9;So, after paying a tehillim visit to our forefathers and touring Hevron, off we were to the Israel Airforce Museum to a live exhibit of real airplanes ranging from Spitfires to Phantoms, MIGs to the Lavi, old choppers to Apaches. In some planes, we were actually allowed to sit in the cockpits. The guys seemed positively exuberant, and for reasons unknown, attacked a chopper almost decapitating its propeller. Oh well, this chopper survived three wars but was no match for our JCT attack squad.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&#9;Then, off we were from there, to the delight of the museum staff, to the sunny south for a day and a half of hiking. We walked through the desert at night with only flashlights, slept at Ein-Gedi, took an adventurous hike climbing down ropes and ladders, ran and got down on all fours and had great laughs.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&#9;In our night Seder, our grand finale for the day, we completed Masechtot Rosh Hashana and Megilla. In our Siyum, the Rabbi discussed the Masechet and gave us insight into the Mishna. We sat around eating, drinking and discussing which Masechet to learn next. If you have any thoughts on the subject, keep it to yourself….just kidding. I'm sure the Rabbi would be glad to hear them.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&#9;For those computer enthusiasts out there, this will make you happy, J.C.T.-Machon Lev, has upgraded all its computers to 450 MHz. It has also opened three new computer labs; now, no more line-ups, just computers free for your computer needs.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&#9;If you are like me, a computer illiterate, a new course that teaches about the Internet has begun. In only its second class, the students have already programmed their own personal web page.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&#9;Now for the best part, J.C.T has nearly completed another modern dormitory building. Let me tell you something about these dorms, then see if you can find better: Internet capabilities, phone lines, refrigerator and kitchenette, built in heating, American style "thick" mattresses, tons of closet space, personal desk and to top it all off, your very own bathroom with a shower and two sinks. You may have a hard time going home.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">&#9;I hope you readers have enjoyed this addition of the newsletter and look forward to reading about future activities here at Machon Lev/ The Jerusalem College of Technology English Speaking Program.</P>
