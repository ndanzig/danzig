<p>  Introduction to Computer Science - Java is a first year computer science 
course designed to teach  the basic concepts of computer science and Object Oriented Programming.  
A basic explanation of how a computer is built and runs is given.  Details of the syntax
of the Java programming language including all structures and operators are taught.  Strings 
and several standard packages are also covered including Swing.  The course also  covers the 
fundamentals of structured programming, functional programming, and object oriented 
programming design. Reading and writing to files are taught.
Abstract classes and interfaces are also taught and their benefits explored.
Different class relationships are covered, including inheritance and composition. Class
diagramming and software design are introduced.  
Method writing, sorting algorithms and recursion are strongly emphasized.  There 
is an extensive accompanying lab which includes many serious projects and utilizes all subjects covered with practical examples.

<h4>Quotes about software writing </h4>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read." - well known, and not a good idea
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Seldom is your first idea  a solution that works." -N.D.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Seldom is the solution that works the best solution." -N.D.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the 
code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as cleverly as possible, you are,
by definition, not smart enough to debug it." - Brian W. Kernighan
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The compiler is king." -ND
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Computers do what you tell them to do, not what you want them to do." -anonymous
