<CENTER><H3>Separating Program Flow Using "if"</H3></CENTER>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We previously learned that  computer programs execute operations in
sequence. &nbsp; &nbsp; This means that the computer will execute
code one line after another. &nbsp; &nbsp; But what if for some
reason we want to skip certain lines of code? &nbsp; &nbsp; In other words,
what if there are certain lines of code we want to do only
if a certain <b>condition</b> holds true? &nbsp; &nbsp; (A <i>condition</i> 
is a programming concept which means if a certain state of affairs is 
true.  &nbsp; &nbsp; A condition in everyday life might be "If it is
rainy, I will stay indoors today." &nbsp; &nbsp; A condition in a computer 
program might be, "If the variable is even, then print on the screen the
sentence "Even number." ") &nbsp; &nbsp; Skipping lines of code in this way is 
called  <b>altering program flow</b>. &nbsp; &nbsp; Skipping lines of code 
is called altering program flow  because it allows a program  to have two 
entirely different sequences, or program flows. &nbsp; &nbsp;
In one sequence, certain code is skipped over and  in the other sequence,
 the code is not skipped.  


<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So how do we skip lines of code? &nbsp; &nbsp;
To skip lines of code we use the reserved word (also called a <i> keyword</i>)&nbsp;
<b>if</b> &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; With the help of the reserved word <i>if</i>
 we can write a line of code in which we say that if and only if  a certain 
condition is
 <b><i>true</i></b> 
then execute the following commands.  &nbsp; &nbsp; What 
I mean by "true" is -  if a certain state of affairs is occuring. &nbsp; &nbsp;
If today is Monday. &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are over 18 years old. &nbsp; &nbsp;
If your salary is less than $1,000 a month.  &nbsp; &nbsp; These are all conditions that may or may not be <i>true</i>. &nbsp; &nbsp;
 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let's see an example in Java.
<br>
<blockquote>
int nachumsNumber; <br>
nachumsNumber = 15; <br>
if (nachumsNumber < 10) <br>
{ <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.println("Number is"); <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.println("smaller than 10"); <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nachumsNumber = 20; <br>
} <br>
System.out.println("Number is"); <br>
System.out.println("not smaller than 10"); <br>

</blockquote>
<br>
I added in some commands which we have not learned yet, so 
this should look confusing.   &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, let's still try to
figure out  what is going on in the code.
&nbsp; &nbsp; What is  the condition? &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Is the condition true or not?  &nbsp; &nbsp;
. . . . The condition is "nachumsNumber < 10".  &nbsp; &nbsp;
This translates into English as "Is the variable
nachumsNumber less than 10." &nbsp; &nbsp; If nachumsNumber is less than
10, then the condition is true.  &nbsp; &nbsp; But if nachumsNumber is not 
less than 10, then we have to admit that the condition is not true. &nbsp; &nbsp;
In our case we initialized the variable nachumsNumber to the value 15.  
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Is the conditon true?  &nbsp; &nbsp; The condition
is not true.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the condition is not
true, the computer will skip over the lines inside the opening and closing
braces &nbsp;  { &nbsp; } &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp;  
Therefore the lines:


<blockquote>
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.println("Number is"); <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.println("smaller than 10"); <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nachumsNumber = 20; <br>
</blockquote>
<br>

will not be executed. &nbsp; &nbsp;  They will be skipped. &nbsp; &nbsp;
(I am not bothering to explain what these lines do, or
what the program does in general. &nbsp; &nbsp;  The only thing it 
is important to understand is how the condition works. &nbsp; &nbsp; But you
 should try to guess what this program does.)
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The above example is really too simple to be 
of interest.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Since nachumsNumber will always be 15,
therefore the lines inside the braces will never be executed. &nbsp; &nbsp;
Later we will see examples in which the variable will change its value and 
therefore the condition will sometimes be true, and sometimes false.


<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The two lines at the end, namely:
<blockquote>
System.out.println("Number is"); <br>
System.out.println("not smaller than 10"); <br>
<br><br>
</blockquote>
will always execute. &nbsp; &nbsp; Why is this? &nbsp; &nbsp; The reason is 
that  the only 
section of code that is skipped is the that which lies between the braces.  &nbsp; &nbsp; ( A section of code inside braces is called a <b> block of 
code</b>.) &nbsp; &nbsp;
Since there is a closing brace before these two lines, they are not within the condition and are therefore not skipped. &nbsp; &nbsp;
They will be executed regardless of whether the condition is true or false. &nbsp; &nbsp;
These lines will write the words "Number is not smaller than 10" onto
the screen. &nbsp; &nbsp;  Does it make sense to write this? &nbsp; &nbsp;
In our example the variable is 15 so it makes sense to print "Number is not
 smaller than 10." since this is true. 
&nbsp; &nbsp;
But what if nachumsNumber had a different value, say 5 ? &nbsp; &nbsp;
If the variable is smaller than 10 then it would be wrong to write
"Number is not smaller than 10"  on the screen. &nbsp; &nbsp;
If you look carefully at the example, you will see that if the 
condition is true, then  nachumsNumber gets
a new value.  &nbsp; &nbsp; It gets the value 20. &nbsp; &nbsp;
By the time the program  prints the sentence "Number is not smaller than 10"
 on the
screen, nachumsNumber is actually 20, so the message <b>is</b> true. 

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Sometimes in life we have more complicated conditions.  &nbsp; &nbsp;
We have two sided conditions.   &nbsp; &nbsp; For example I might say,
"If today is rainy I will stay indoors, otherwise I will play football."
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  This statement means that only if today is
rainy will I stay indoors, but if today is not rainy then I will play football.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  If the day is sunny I will play football.  &nbsp; &nbsp; But also if the day is cloudy (but not rainy) I will play football.   &nbsp; &nbsp;
If the day is cold I will play football.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Even if the day is snowy I will
playfootball.   &nbsp; &nbsp; Only if the day is rainy will I stay indoors.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  That is the meaning of otherwise. &nbsp; &nbsp;  Otherwise means, "in all other
conditions" I will play football. &nbsp; &nbsp; In Java we use the keyword
<b>else</b> to mean otherwise.


<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A simple  programming example in English of the <i>if 
else</i> combition is
<blockquote>

If variable is greater than 2,500,000,000  print "Number is too large", else 
print "Number is acceptable size."
<br><br>
</blockquote>
Let us see the above English (also called  psuedo-code because it
is English which resembles computer languages or codes) translated into Java. 

<blockquote>
<br>
if (variable > 2,500,000,000)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;System.out.println("Number is too large."); <br>
}<br>
else<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;System.out.println("Number is acceptable size."); <br>
}<br>
<br><br>
</blockquote>
Notice that the else using braces &nbsp; { &nbsp; } the same way the
if uses them. &nbsp; &nbsp; In this example only one of
the two senteces will be printed.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Which sentence gets printed depends
on whether the condition of the if is true.  If the condition is true, 
then the first sentence will be printed, otherwise ( or <b>else</b> ) the
second sentence will be printed. &nbsp; &nbsp; In any case, both sentences can
never be printed. &nbsp; &nbsp; The program has two options of what to print
and the option will be selected in accordance with the truth or falsehood of 
the condition in the <i>if</i> statement.  
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In Java there is also a keyword true and a keyword false.
the keyword true is always true in a condition statement and
false is always false.
Therefore,
<br>
<br>
<tt>if(true)</tt>
<br>
is always true. 

There is a primitive data type called <b>boolean</b> which can be assigned true
or false.  It is useful as a variable in condition statements.

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>If</i>s can be <b>nested</b> one in side the other.
