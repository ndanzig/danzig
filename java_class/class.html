What is a class?  A class is a computer programming  model of a real-world 
thing.  It is basically a program which can be run by another
program.  Things in the real world
have descriptions ( attributes )  and things they do (
behavior or methodology). So classes have attributes and behavior.
The attributes of a class are the data the class will store and use.
The behavior is what the class is capable of doing with its data.
Another program or class can then ask the class to perform one of its behaviors
by running one of the methods in the class.   

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But classes are not exactly programs though every program must contain at 
least one class.  They are actually blueprints for creating objects.  To make 
this clearer I will use as an example the data type <font color="blue">
 int </font>.
We call <font color="blue"> int </font> a data type because it defines a certain type of data that you can create.  You can make a variable of type <font color="blue"> int </font> if you want by writing something like this:
<p>
<tt>int myVariableName;</tt>
<p>
This will create a variable or object of type int. We can then use this 
variable to store data.   But what if we wanted a data type which is 
capable of storing two ints inside it, or, let's say, three ints and a string?
Java has no data type like this, but we can create our own data type.
This is called a user defined data type, or a class.

<p>
But this is not all.  The class we create can also have built-in methods.
Just like String has many built-in methods, like for example charAt( ), our class can have its own methods which we define for it.  
These methods are called the behavior of the class.  
It is the possible behaviors the class can exhibit.

<p>
Here is the basic form of a class:
<pre>
class anyName
{
<b>//attributes</b>
<i><font color="brown"> list of variables </font></i>
type X; //The list will be composed of lines like this. The "type" could be int or float etc.
<b>//behavior</b>
anyName(<i><font color="brown"> parameter list</font></i>)//constructor method
   {
   <i><font color="brown"> some code</font></i>
   }
someMethodName( <i><font color="brown"> parameter list</font></i>  )
   {
   <i><font color="brown"> some code</font></i>
   }

}//end class
</pre>
<p>

All classes should have this basic form though a class can have lack
attributes or lack behaviors. <i>anyName</i> is the name of the class.
The name is follow by a set of braces { }. Inside the braces
the attributes are listed and the behavior is defined (i.e. the methods
of the class are defined).  
Every class must have at least one constructor method.
Note that the constructor method has the same name 
as the class and has no return type. (I will explain the constructor method
later.) Here is a simple example of a class which follows the above format:
<p>
<pre>
class aClass
{
//attributes
int something;
//behavior
aClass(int a)//constructor method
   {
   something=a;
   }
someMethod( )
   {
   System.out.println("This is a simple behavior of the class anyName. \nThe 
attribute of this class is only the String"+something);
   }

}//end class
</pre>
<p>
Once I have defined this class, I can use it in my main class, in my main
program. (Seperate classes are created in their own seperate files, one file
per class.) Here is an example of a possible excerpt from the 
main program that uses this class:
<p>
<pre>

aClass myVariable;<i><font color="brown">//declare a variable (object) of type aClass</font></i>
myVariable = new aClass("Hello, Mr. aClass"); <i><font color="brown">//run aClass's constructor method
</font></i>
myVariable.someMethod( );<i><font color="brown">//this will run the method someMethod in the object myVariable
</font></i>
</pre>

<p>We created the object myVariable and assigned its attribute the String "Hello, Mr. aClass". 
Then we ran the method someMethod( ).  Notice that we ran the method by first
writing the name of the object we created followed by a period (.) and then the name of the 
method.  This indicates that we wish to run the method someMethod( ) that is associated
with (that is inside) the particular object myVariable.
When this method executes, it will extract
the data in myVariable which is the String "Hello, Mr. aClass" and use it.  
The String will then  be part of what
the method someMethod( ) will print.  In this code excerpt I created one object
of type aClass.  I could have created several object of the type 
class aClass but I chose not to.

<p>
There is no programming problem which requires the use of classes.  In fact many 
computer languages do not have classes at all.  But it was found that
programming problems can be broken down into component parts and solved
with less confusion if classes are used.  In very small programs the 
benefits of classes are small and hard to perceive.  But for programs
that require large numbers of people to work on them and that contain
millions of lines of code, classes make the job of
organizing the program infinitely easier. When attempting to use classes in 
a program, the first thing to do with the programming problem
 is to try to see if there are any real world things which you can model.
Then, make classes for them and give the classes useful behavior.
This should help to organize your final program.


<p>
When a class is created ( instanciated ) and given data you must run the <font color="blue">
new</font> command.  This will cause the constructor function to be run.
Simple declaring an object (instance) of your class will not really create the class.
All this will do is create a refernce to an object which can later be assigned a 
real object to which to refer.
The constructor function actually creates the object.  Therefore, it is run only 
once per instance.  
The purpose of the constuctor function is
 to assign values to the attributes of the class and to actually create the object.
 Normally all non-static 
attributes  (the data of the class) are assigned initial values in this way.  
Non-static attributes are different for each instance.  If you would be able to assign 
them values in the class definition, then all instances ( objects ) of the class would have 
the same values. This is not desireable since you want the attributes 
to be different.   You can only give initial values when 
the new instance is created, i.e. when the <font color="blue"> new </font> 
command is run.  At that time the new instance will be created and assign
it initial values. You can of course change the values of the attributes later
by writing a method to do this and running that method later with new values.
This method might be called setAttributes( ).
<p>
Class attributes cannot
be assign values in the class definition (in the list of data in the class)
 unless they are defined as static.
Defining an attribute as static means that there is only one 
attribute of this name per <b>class</b>.  In other words, no matter how 
many instances of the class I make, that static attribute will 
only have one value.  A static attribute will be created and initialized
at compile time.  Therefore, it  exists even before any new is run.
Static attributes might be useful if I wanted to keep tract of the number of 
instaces of a particular class I have created. 
<p> Similarly, static methods only exist once 
per class.
They are called class methods.  We saw an example of  one with Strings. It was
called valueOf.  If you recall, to run this method we  write String.valueOf( ).
We did not need to create a instance of type String to run this method.  
We simply used the class name to call the method.
Static methods are called in this way.
We do not write <font color="green"> instance</font>.method( ) instead 
we write <font color="green">Class</font>.method( ). Static methods can do 
anything except access ( read or change ) instance attributes.  They can create variables, accept 
parameters, and access static class attributes.

<a href="./dogexample.html"> Here is an fully implemented example of a class which models a real world thing, a dog.
</a>I did not fully implement it.  For example, I could have given it
methods like goForAWalk( ) or bark( ).
<p>
<a href="./Ice_Cream.html"> Here is an example demonstrating the use of a 
static method in a very simple class.</a>


<p>
Exercise: Think of any real world thing and model it with a class.
