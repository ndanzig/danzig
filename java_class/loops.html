<CENTER><H3>Repeating the same action more than once</H3></CENTER>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
We have seen that to get a computer to do what we want we must
tell it every step, down to the last detail. &nbsp; 
This can be very tedious. &nbsp;  It is especially
tedious when we want it to do the same action several times.
&nbsp;   For example in the chapter on sequence we 
wrote a recipie for a computer to mix a cake.
&nbsp;   To get the computer to stir the bowl five (5)
times, we had to write  "stir contents of bowl with mixing spoon" 
five (5) times.
&nbsp;   Wouldn't it be nice if we could tell the computer
"Do the following action five (5) times: stir contents of bowl with 
mixing spoon."
&nbsp;   This would certainly save us some typing. &nbsp; 
Especially if we had wanted the computer to stir the bowl a
hundred (100) times! &nbsp; 


<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  So how do we tell the computer
to repeat an action many times? &nbsp;  Why not write something like
what we saw above? 
<blockquote> "Do the following action five (5) times: stir contents of bowl with mixing spoon."
</blockquote>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This would work for our case, but sometimes the situation is more complicated.
&nbsp;   Really, we want to tell the computer "stir contents of bowl 
with mixing spoon
<b>until mixture is smooth</b>." &nbsp;   This may take five
mixes, but it may take ten or twenty.  &nbsp;  If we generalize our
case, we could say "Do something until something else changes." &nbsp; 
Now, as we saw in computer programs we store "things" in variables. &nbsp;
 &nbsp; We can refine our instruction to something like "Do something until
variable X changes." 

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what does "changes" mean?  &nbsp; 
Changes in what way?  &nbsp;  Variables are just numbers.  &nbsp; 
How do numbers change?   &nbsp;  They can either increase or decrease.
 &nbsp;  So we could have some variable increase each time we 
stir the bowl, and then when that variable is larger than, say, five (5), 
we could end our action.  &nbsp;  This is exactly how programs really
work.  Let's see an example first in English and then in Java.

<blockquote> make a variable and call it "counter" <br>
assign the value "1" to the "counter"  <br>
do the following as long as counter is less than "6"
 
<blockquote> add "1" to counter <br>
write this message to the screen "Hi mom!"
  </blockquote> 
<br>
  </blockquote> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This "English" is intended to be similar to a programming language
but it should be understandable.  &nbsp;  (Note: I gave the name
"counter" to the variable, but I could have given any other name just as well.
 &nbsp;  I could have called it "George", but I like to give meaningful names.  &nbsp;  This
 this variable is supposed to count, I called it "counter.")  &nbsp;   Try to understand the
 logic of the above instructions. 
 &nbsp;  How many times will the message get printed?  &nbsp; 
Now let's see this is Java.  &nbsp;  Try to match up each line of
English above with the Java below.



<blockquote>  
int counter;<br>
counter = 1;<br>
while ( counter < 6)<br>
{<br>
<blockquote> 
counter = counter+1; <br>
System.out.println("Hi mom!");<br> 
</blockquote> 
}<br>
<br>
</blockquote> 

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Can you match up the two versions? &nbsp;  Try again! &nbsp; 
One thing should confuse you.  What does this line mean: "counter = counter+1;"?
 &nbsp;  How can a variable equal the same variable plus 1?  &nbsp;
 &nbsp;  That breaks the rules of algebra! &nbsp;  If counter is 1,
well, 1 does not equal 1 + 1. &nbsp;   What is our mistake? &nbsp; 
&nbsp; Our mistake is that we think = means equals, remember it means <b>
assign the value on the right side to the left side</b>. &nbsp; 
In our case that translates to assign the value 1 + 1 to counter. 
&nbsp;  Counter had been 1, now it will be 2. &nbsp; 
Another way of thinking about what this line means is to translate it as 
follows: "the new value of counter will now be what the old value of
 counter was, plus one." &nbsp;  Think about this for a moment.


<p> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  You should notice that the two lines inside
the braces { } are repeated 5 times. &nbsp;  How does this happen? 
&nbsp;   We said programs are executed in sequence, how can the 
computer execute the same line more than once? &nbsp; 
What the computer does when it sees the closing brace } is to return to the 
condition inside the "while" line.&nbsp;  ("<b>while</b>" is another  keyword.) &nbsp; 
 If that condition is true
then the computer goes back into the code inside the braces { }. &nbsp; (Code inside braces 
is called a <i>code block</i> or a <i>code section</i>.) &nbsp;  
If the condition is not true, then it skips over the braces, just 
like in an " if ".    
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The difference from "if" is that here the
computer jumps up to the top of the "while" when it gets to the end. &nbsp;
The computer then re-checks the condition of the "while" to see if it is still 
true before proceeding to do the code section again. &nbsp;  In an "if" once the
 code inside the braces is execute, the computer never comes back to it. &nbsp;  If we 
think of a "while" as a way to get the computer to go down and 
then jump up to the top again, we can visualize a kind of looping effect.
 &nbsp;   Programmers call this construction a "<b>loop</b>".
 

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Terms to remember: counter, while, code section, and loop.
