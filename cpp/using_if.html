<p>
In life we often face conditions.  Our parents may have made conditions
like, "If you don't come home on time, I won't 
let you go on any more mountain climbing expeditions." 
"If you take out the trash then I will give you some 
strawberries and whipped cream."
In school we may face conditions too; "If your grade point average is over 90
you will be exempt from the final exam."
A condition means that if a certain state of affairs occurs, then a 
certain result will happen.  There can also be  negative conditions (like the 
first one above): if something  does not occur, then a certain result will 
happen.

<p>In all of these statements there is the condition part  
( "If you take out the trash" ) and the result part ( 
"then I will give you some strawberries and whipped cream").
When deciding whether the result should be brought about, we have to decide if 
the condition has been met. In real world conditions we set up an
expected state of affairs and then see if the actual reality conforms to that 
expectation.  This is called testing whether reality conforms to our
expectation. This same concept exists in computer science. We
 say that we have to
<b>test</b> if a condition
has been met.  If it has been met then the condition is said to be
 <b>true</b>. 
If it has not been met  the condition is  <b>false</b>.
For example, if you do take out the trash then
 the condition is <b>true</b> and you get the strawberries. 
But if you don't take out the trash, 
the condition is  <b>false</b> and 
you won't get the strawberries.

We can generalize and say conditional statements are of the form 
<p>
<b>If </b> <i> some condition </i> is <b>true
<br> then</b> <i>some result occurs</i>.

<p> But whereas in the real world we compare 
some real action or thing with some expected action or thing, in computer
 science  we don't have real actions.  What we have are variables (containing
numbers) and literals (actual numbers). So in order to create a  
condition  we need to  compare one or more of these variables or 
literals to another variable or literal.  This comparison relationship is
our <b>test</b> condition. 



<p>When comparing variables in C++ we use 3 basic comparison 
or testing operators.  These are the <b>greater than</b>  operator
 ( <b>&gt;</b> ),
the <b>less than</b> operator ( <b>&lt;</b> ) and the <b>equals</b> operator
( <b>==</b> ).  Note that
we use two = symbols to distingush the equals operator from the 
assignment operator which is one =  symbol. 

<p> But how exactly do we set up the comparison so that 
the  code we want  will be executed if the condition is true?
To do this we use the keyword 
<b>if</b>&nbsp;. With the help of the keyword <b>if</b>
 we can write a line of code in which we say that if and only if  a certain 
condition is
 <b>true</b> 
then execute the following commands.


<p>If we wanted to test if some variable was larger than 10 
we would write 
<blockquote>
if ( someVariable > 10 )
</blockquote>

If we wanted to test if it was smaller than 10 
we would write 
<blockquote>
if ( someVariable < 10 )
</blockquote>


And if we wanted to test if some variable was equal to 10 
we would write 
<blockquote>
if ( someVariable == 10 )
</blockquote>

In all of these example, we have an <b>if</b> followed by a condition
which is inside a set of parenthesis ( ). But how do we tell the
computer what to do when this condition is <b>true</b>?
For this we use a set of braces { } immediately following the 
<b>if</b>.
  Such a  section of code inside braces is called a <b> block of 
code</b> or a   <b> code block</b>.



 For example,
<blockquote>
if ( someVariable == 10 )
<br>
{
<br>
cout &lt;&lt; "The number is 10!";
<br>
}
</blockquote>

In the above code segment, the line 
cout &lt;&lt; "The number is 10!"; is a block of code.  In this example,
if someVariable is
equal to 10, then 
the message <i> 
The number is 10! </i> will be printed. 
 I can also have multiple lines inside the  braces.
In such a case, if the condition is true, all the lines will be executed.
If the condition is not true, then the computer will skip the entire section 
inside the braces and continue executing the program from after the close 
brace }. 

<p> Let's see another example of using <b>if</b>.

<blockquote>
int mySalary; <br>
mySalary = 1200; <br>
if (mySalary < 1000) <br>
{ <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; "The salary is"; <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; "smaller than $1000. Give him a raise." &lt;&lt; endl; <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mySalary = 2000; <br>
} <br>
cout &lt;&lt; "Now the salary is"; <br>
cout  &lt;&lt;  "not smaller than $1000"; 

</blockquote>

Try asking yourself, What is  the condition?
Is the condition true or not?  
. . . .  The condition is "mySalary < 1000".  &nbsp; &nbsp;
This translates into English as "Is the variable
mySalary less than 1000."  If mySalary is less than
1000, then the condition is true. But if mySalary is not 
less than 1000, then we have to admit that the condition is not true.
In our case, we initialized the variable mySalary to the value 1200.  
  Is our testing condition true?   The condition
is not true.  Since the condition is not
true, the computer will skip over the lines inside the opening and closing
braces &nbsp;  { &nbsp; } &nbsp;. &nbsp;
Therefore the lines:


<blockquote>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; "The salary is"; <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; "smaller than $1000. Give him a raise."; <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mySalary = 2000; <br>
</blockquote>


will not be executed.   They will be skipped.
So we see how the condition works. The condition causes us to skip or not skip
 the print-out depending on whether the condition is false or true.

<p>  The above example is really too simple to be 
of any real interest.   Since mySalary will always be 1200,
therefore the lines inside the braces will never be executed.
Later we will see examples in which the variable will change its value and 
therefore the condition will sometimes be true, and sometimes false.
(Can you think of a way of combining what we have learned about user interfaces
to allow mySalary to vary? Try it out.)

<p>
The two lines at the end, namely:
<blockquote>
cout<<"Now the salary is"; <br>
cout<< "not smaller than $1000"; <br>

</blockquote>
will always execute (whether the condition is true or false).  
Why is this?  The reason is that the only 
section of code that is skipped is the section that lies between the braces.
Since there is a closing brace before these two lines, they are not within the
 condition and are therefore not skipped. 
They will be executed regardless of whether the condition is true or false. 

These lines will write 
the words "Now the salary is not smaller than $1000"
 onto
the screen.   

<p>Now we can ask does this program  make sense? Should we print 
the words "Now the salary is not smaller than $1000" always?
 In our example the variable is 1200 so it does make sense to
 print "Now the number is not
 smaller than 1000." since this is true. 
But what if myNumber had a different value, say 50 ? 
If the variable is smaller than 1000 then it would be wrong to write
"Now the salary is not smaller than $1000"  on the screen.
But if you look carefully at the example, you will see that if the 
condition is true, then  mySalary gets
a new value.  It gets the value 2000.
So therefore, by the time the program  prints the sentence 
"Now the salary is not smaller
 than $1000"
 on the
screen, mySalary would actually be 2000, so the message <i>is</i> true
no matter what mySalary is to start with. It would be nice if 
salaries could be raised like this.

<p> 
Sometimes in life we have more complicated conditions. 
We have two sided conditions.    For example I might say,
"If today is rainy I will stay indoors, otherwise I will play football."
   This statement means that only if today is
rainy will I stay indoors, but if today is not rainy then I will play football.
So, logically if the day is sunny I will play football.  
But also if the day is not sunny, say it is  cloudy but not rainy, then also
 I will play football. If the day is cold I will also play football.   Even
 if the day is hailing and snowy I will
play football.  My condition stated that only if the day is rainy will I 
stay indoors and not play 
football.   That is the meaning of otherwise.  Otherwise means, "in all other
conditions" I will play football. In C++ we use the keyword
<b>else</b> to mean otherwise (mostly because it is shorter).


<p>  A simple  programming example in English of the <i>if 
else</i> combination would be the following: 
<blockquote>

If variable is greater than 2,500,000,000  print "Number is too large", else 
print "Number is an acceptable size."

</blockquote>
(The above English is also called  <b>pseudo-code</b> because it
is English which resembles computer languages or codes, but is not  
any specific computer language.) 
<br>
Let us see the above English translated into C++.  


<blockquote>

if (variable &gt; 2500000000)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;"Number is too large."; <br>
}<br>
else<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;"Number is acceptable size."; <br>
}

</blockquote>
Notice that the <b>else</b> also uses braces { &nbsp; } the same way the
<b>if</b> uses them. In this example, only one of
the two sentences will be printed.  Which sentence gets printed depends
on whether the condition of the if is true.  If the condition is true, 
then the first sentence will be printed, otherwise ( or <b>else</b> ) the
second sentence will be printed. In any case, both sentences will
never be printed in the same run of this test condition. The program has two
 options of what to print
and the option will be selected in accordance with the truth or falsehood of 
the condition in the <b>if</b> statement. 
<p>
In C++ there is also a keyword <b>true</b> and a keyword <b>false</b>.
The keyword <b>true</b> is always true in a condition statement and 
<b>false</b> is always false in a condition statement.
Further more <b>any non-zero value is considered true in a condition statement.</b> Zero is considered false but the numbers 7, -7, -514, 8900 and 1 are all 
considered true.  
 Therefore, 
<br>
<br>
<tt>if(true)</tt>
<br>
is always a true condition.  And furthermore,
<br>
<br>
<tt>if(1) </tt>
<br>
is also true.
<p>You can also use the <b>not</b> operator ( ! ) to achieve the opposite 
from the normal true/false results.  For example,
<br>
<br>
<tt>if(!true)</tt>
<br>
will never be a true condition. And so too
<br>
<tt>if(!1) </tt>
<br>
is also not true. 

<p>In addition to the primitive data types we have used already, there is a 
primitive data type called <b>bool</b> which can be assigned true
or false , or 0 or 1. 
Bool is like int, but it cannot have thousands of different values, it can 
only have two possible values: either 0 or 1 . Bool 
  is useful as a variable in condition statements. 
I can use a bool like this

<blockquote>
bool someVariable = 0;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <b>Right!</b>
<br>bool someVariable = 1;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <b>Right!</b>
<br>
bool someVariable = true;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <b>Right!</b>
<br>
bool someVariable = 2;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <b>Wrong!</b> someVariable will get the value 1 instead of 2 since 1 is the maximum value a bool can hold.<br>
bool someVariable = -1;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <b>Wrong!</b>
<br>if (someVariable) &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;    <b>Right!</b>
<br>if (someVariable==true) &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <b>Right!</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>If</b>s can be <b>nested</b> one in side the other. 
For example, let's say that in order to get a driver's license in Israel you 
must be over 18 years old and you must pass a test.  How would I express 
this with an <b>if</b> ?  One <b>if</b>  is not enough since I have two 
conditions. 
(Later we will see that you can actually combine two conditions into one 
<b>if</b>  statement)  Therefore, in our case I need to use two <b>if</b>s as
 follows:
<blockquote>
<tt>
int age = 16;<br>
bool passTest = true;<br>
 if(age > 17 ) <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{ <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if(passTest) <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{ <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
cout<<"Congratulations, you will get you license.";
 <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;else <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{ <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
cout<<"Your are old enough, but you didn't pass the test. Sorry.";
 <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } <br>
 else <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{ <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if(passTest) <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{ <br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
cout<<"You passed the test, but you aren't old enough. Sorry.";
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;else <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{ <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
cout<<"You didn't passed the test, and you aren't old enough. Sorry.";
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} <br></font>
</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
Read the above example carefully.  The text lines outputted explain
what each case is.
Notice how I indented each time I made a new block of code.  I did this
for better readability. You should always indent in this way.
You can see graphically how there are if/else structures within each of the
 outer if and else sections.

Thus, in the if part of the outer  if/else there is a complete
 if/else structure.  And in the outer else there is a complete 
 if/else structure.  Since one set of
if/elses is within another set, one is said to be nested within the other.
(I believe the term nesting derives from the fact that bowls (or birds' nests)
 can be placed one inside the other, provided the inner
ones are a little bit smaller than the outer ones.)
These are nested if/elses. 
You should notice that there are four possible cases when we have two 
conditions.  I have written the logical output for each case.  In my example, 
the person passed the test but was too young. He will be told,
<br>"You passed the test, but you aren't old enough. Sorry."


<p> In addition to 
&gt; and &lt; there is also the possibility of testing
greater than or equal &gt;= to and less than or equal to &lt;=
.  You can use these  when you want to include the equals possibility.
For example, <xmp> if ( someVariable < 10 ) </xmp>
will be true for all numbers smaller than 10 and that is all.

However,  <xmp> if ( someVariable <= 10 ) </xmp>
will be true for all numbers smaller than 10 and it will  also be true
for the number 10.
The same is the case with the &gt;= symbol.
For example, <xmp> if ( someVariable > 10 ) </xmp>
will be true for all numbers larger than 10 and that is all.

However,  <xmp> if ( someVariable >= 10 ) </xmp>
will be true for all numbers larger than 10 and it will  also be true
for the number 10.

<p>The not operator ( ! ) can also be used to express the idea 
of two things not being equal.  For example, if
I wanted to test if a certain variable is not equal to zero I could 
write this:
<pre>
<tt>if(variable != 0) </tt>
</pre>
Notice that in this case I write only one = symbol, not ==.
!== is incorrect. By the way, I could make the same condition by writing simply
<pre>
<tt>if(variable) </tt>
</pre>
 since all non-zero values are considered true, both these statements are 
equivalent.  Both condition statements are true for values like 7, 8 and -300 
(7 is not zero, and 7 is a true value).
<p> I can also use the not operator in conjuction with entire conditions.
For example, say I want to test for number greater than 10. 
The best way to do this is by writing something like this:
<pre>
<tt>if(variable > 10) </tt>
</pre>
But I could also write 
<pre>
<tt>if (!(variable <= 10)) </tt>
</pre>
Notice how I put the ! in front of the condition. Read such a statement
 as "if variable is not less than or equal to 10."  This can get 
confusing, but with practice you can get used to it. In such a case you should
just write the first version since it is clearer, but sometimes it is clearer
if you negate some condition as in the second version.

<p>Sometimes you may need to combine two or more conditions.
Let's say you want to test if a certain variable is betweem 1 and
100.  For this problem you need to make two tests: Is the variable
greater than 1? And, is the variable less than 100?  Only if both conditions
are true is the condition true. To combine two conditions in this way I need
to use the <b>logical and</b> operator.  It works like this:
<pre>
<tt>if (variable > 1 && variable < 100) </tt>
</pre>
Notice how I use two and ( & ) symbols.  Using one would be a mistake. 
One  and symbol is called the <b>bitwise and</b> operator and  we will
 learn to use it in a later chapter. The above example should be read like this
"if variable is greater than 1 and variable is also less than 100."
For clarity's sake, you should group the two parts of the condition with 
parenthesis like this:
<pre>
<tt>if ( (variable > 1 ) && (variable < 100) ) </tt>
</pre>
Not only is this more clear for you to read, it will also help prevent logical 
errors.
<p>
I can use the && operator to combine  any conditions that I choose.
Therefore, I can also combine conditions involving different variables.
For example,  I may want to give a grade of 'A' to
any student who has an average of 90% or more and 
 attendence over 75%.  I would write this condition like this:
<pre>
<tt>if ( (average >= 90) && (attendence > 75) ) </tt>
</pre>
<p>
Since there is a logical and operator, there is also a <b>logical or</b> 
operator. It looks like this || . We use this when we want to combine two or more conditions
and to check if any one of them is true.  Say for example, I need
to check if a certain variable is either 1 or 7 or 14.  I would use the
logical or operator  like this:
<pre>
<tt>if ( (variable == 1 ) || (variable == 7)  || (variable == 14)  ) </tt>
</pre>
<!--  
The final operator used to combine conditions is the <b>exclusive or</b> 
operator.
This one looks like this ^^ . What it means is if one but not more than
one of the conditions is true. For example lets say I want
to give a cherry pie to anyone who shoveled the snow or who mowed the lawn.
But anyone who did both gets nothing. (He's probably a liar since you can't 
mow the lawn if it's coverd with snow!)
I would test such a condition like this:

<pre>
<tt>if ( (snow == true ) ^^ (lawn == true) ) </tt>
</pre --->
<p>
All of these operators can be combined in any number of ways.  You
can use the not operator on all of them too.  Try to express
your conditions in the simplest form.  The best condition statements
can be read quickly by a normal person.  Do not try to 
confuse your reader or yourself.

As we have seen, we use conditions in C++ programming when there are 
parts of our  program that should be
 skipped in certain circumstances and not skipped in others.
We previously learned that  computer programs execute operations in
sequence. This means that the computer will execute
one command after another, going down the page. 
But when we want do to certain lines of code only
if a certain condition holds true we set up a condition test.
Skipping lines of code in this way is 
called  <b>altering program flow</b>. It 
is called altering program flow  because it allows a program  to have two 
entirely different sequences, or program flows. 
In one sequence, certain code is skipped over and  in the other sequence,
 the code is not skipped.  
Ultimately, this is the function of condition statements.

<p>Here is a table of all the condition  operators and their meanings.

<table>
<tr><td>Operator</td><td>Meaning</td></tr>
<tr><td> == </td><td> is equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td> != </td><td> is not equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td> > </td><td> greater than</td></tr>
<tr><td> < </td><td> less than</td></tr>
<tr><td> >= </td><td> greater than or equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td> <= </td><td> less than or equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td> && </td><td> and  </td></tr>
<tr><td> || </td><td> or </td></tr>
