<p>
The most basic type of loop is the <b>while</b> loop which we have  seen in 
the previous chapter.  
In truth, all you ever need to use is the <b>while</b> loop.  But two other
loop structures were created to be used in certain cases.
<p>
Sometimes you may want to do a loop once no matter what
and only check the condition statement to decide whether to 
do the loop a second time.  A classic example of this (when you
want to skip the first-time condition check) is when 
you are printing a menu for the user.  

<p>
I will show you the basic structure of this kind of loop and then a menu example.
The loop is called a <b> do while </b> loop.  Here is the structure: 


<pre>
do {
 ........... 

} while ( <i>condition</i> ) ;

</pre


<p>So you see it is rather like the <b>while</b> loop , but the while comes at the end.
Be careful to remember the semi-colon ;  at the end.  Here is the menu example
I promised:
<tt>
<blockquote>

<tt>int input;
<br>do {
<br>cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter any positive integer, (-1 to quit)"&lt;&lt;endl;
<br>cin&gt;&gt;input;
<br>cout&lt;&lt;"You entered a "&lt;&lt;input&lt;&lt;endl;
<br>}while(input != -1);

</tt>
</blockquote>
<p> When this loop runs, it will output something like this

<pre>
<tt>
Please enter any positive integer, (-1 to quit)
5
You entered a 5
Please enter any positive integer, (-1 to quit)
-1
</tt>
</pre> 
<p>If I had used a while loop, I would have had to repeat code like 
 this:
<blockquote>
<tt>int input;
<br>cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter any positive integer, (-1 to quit)"&lt;&lt;endl;
<br>cin&gt;&gt;input;
<br>cout&lt;&lt;"You entered a "&lt;&lt;input&lt;&lt;endl;
<br>while(input != -1)
<br>cout&lt;&lt;"Please enter any positive integer, (-1 to quit)"&lt;&lt;endl;
<br>cin&gt;&gt;input;
<br>cout&lt;&lt;"You entered a "&lt;&lt;input&lt;&lt;endl;
<br>}

</tt>
  


</blockquote>

<p> So you can see that my do while has saved me some hastles and potential confusions.
<p> There is another kind of loop, the <b> for loop</b>. It has the advantage of compactly
structuring the common commands for using a counter. Use a <b>for loop</b> when you need to use
and initialize a counter.  Here is the stucture:

<pre>
for  ( <i>initialization</i> ; <i>condition</i> ; <i>incrementation</i> )
{

.....

}
</pre>
<p> You will note that there are three sections separated by semi-colons ; . The 
<b>for loop</b> requires exactly two semi-colons always. If you want to do two or
more initializations or incrementations, simple semerate them by commas.  You cannot
have more that one condition, but you can create complex conditions just like in a 
while loop.


<p>The <i>initialization</i> is for setting the counter(s).  You can also declare
variables in the initalization section. The <i>condition</i>  section is 
the same as the condition of the while and do while loops.  The <i>incrementation</i> 
is pretty much for incrementing the counter, like i++ of counter++, but
actually you can do just about any command here.  In general, just use the
incrementation section for incrememting your counter(s).  Here is a basic example:

<blockquote>
<tt>for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 10 ; i++)
<br>{
<br>cout&lt;&lt;"5 times " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt;" is " &lt;&lt; i * 5&lt;&lt;endl;
<br>}

</tt>

</blockquote>


<p> The output of the above would be 
<pre>
5 times 0 is 0
5 times 1 is 5
5 times 2 is 10
5 times 3 is 15
5 times 4 is 20
5 times 5 is 25
5 times 6 is 30
5 times 7 is 35
5 times 8 is 40
5 times 9 is 45
<pre>

<p> Some other for loop possibilities are:

<tt><br> 
for ( int i = 0, int j=10 ; i &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; j &lt; 100 ; i++ , j*=2) // two counters, double condition 
<br>for ( i = 0, j=10 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++ , j--) // two counters, one condition 
<br>for ( i = 0 ;;) //infinite loop
<br>for ( i = 0 ;;) // infinite loop

<br>etc.
