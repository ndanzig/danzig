<p>


Exception Handling is a mechanism for dealing with exceptional circumstances or errors.
When an exception occurs, control is transefered to a block of code called an exception handler.
This system is especially useful for dealing with an error in a function. An alternate approach would
be to have the function return -1 when an error occurs. But in some functions, -1 might be a legitimate
return value.  In that case we would not know if an error occured or if our function returned -1 
correctly.


<p>
The throwing and catching of exceptions solves this problem. 
To catch exceptions we must place a portion of code under exception inspection. 
This is done by enclosing that portion of code in a <b>try</b> block.
 When an exceptional circumstance arises within that block, an exception is thrown that 
transfers the control to the exception handler. If no exception is thrown, the code continues
 normally and all handlers are ignored.
<p>
A exception is thrown by using the <b>throw</b> keyword from inside the try block.
 Exception handlers are declared with the keyword <b>catch</b>,
 which must be placed immediately after the try block. Here is an example of a simple 
divide function which throws an exception if an attempt to divide by zero was made.

<blockquote><pre>
float divide(int a, int b )
{
if (b == 0)
    throw -1;
else
    return (float)a/b;
}


int main()
{
try {
     divide (7,0);
    }
catch (int error)
    {
     if (-1==error)
          cout<<"Don't divide by zero!!";
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Notice that in the main we do not simply run the function, but we <i>try</i> to run
the function.  We then can catch an error if it occurs. The catch segment must be immediately after the try segment. It 
is written similarly to a function.  In the parenthesis in the type and name of the exception you intend to 
catch.  The name is arbitrary, but the type is significant.  If 
you write the wrong type, the exception will not be caught.


<p>In fact, you can have two catch statements after a try, each with diffferent parameter type.
This allows you to throw differently typed exceptions.  Let's see an example:


<blockquote><pre>
float divide(int a, int b )
{
if (b == 0)
    throw -1;
if (b == 1)
    throw 'a';
return (float)a/b;
}


int main()
{
try {
     divide (7,0);
    }
catch (int error)
    {
          cout<<"Don't divide by zero!!";
    }
catch (char error)
    {
          cout<<"Why are dividing by one? That won't do much!";
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>


<p>Notice that I have remove the else in the divide function.  That is because 
it was unneccessary since one the exception is thrown, therest of the function will not execute.
Also notice that I removed the if in the catch segments.  That is because since I am throwing just one 
error for each type, there is not point to check the value.  The type is enough to distinguish the exceptions.
If the type is int then I know it was a divide by zero. If the type was char then I know there was a divide by one, 
which is not really an error, but I just wanted to demonstrate muliple error handling.

<p> 
I could achieve the same result with just one catch, but I would then need to check the value of the thrown 
exception.  See this example:


<blockquote><pre>
float divide(int a, int b )
{
if (b == 0)
    throw -1;
if (b == 1)
    throw -2;
return (float)a/b;
}


int main()
{
try {
     divide (7,0);
    }
catch (int error)
    {
     if (-1==error)
          cout<<"Don't divide by zero!!";
     if (-2==error)
          cout<<"Why are dividing by one? That won't do much!";
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>


<p>
If we use an ellipsis (...) as the parameter of catch, that handler will catch any exception no matter
 what the type of the throw  exception is. This can be used as a 
default handler that catches all exceptions not caught by other handlers if it is specified at last. If it is specified
 first then all following catches will be ignored.  This is a logical error.

<blockquote><pre>
try {
  // some code
}

catch (int error) { cout << "int exception"; }
catch (char error) { cout << "char exception"; }
catch (...) { cout << "default exception"; }
</pre>
</blockquote>


In this case the last handler would catch any exception thrown with any parameter that is neither an int nor a char.

After an exception has been caught the program execution resumes after all the relevant catch blocks.
<p>
In a command like  

<blockquote><code> int a;
<br> try {
   <br>  a = divide (7,0);
    <br>}
</code>
</blockquote>
an exception will be thrown.  The variable "a" will not be asigned any value at all.

<h4>Standard Exceptions</h4>
<a name="standardException"></a>

<p>Instead of throwing an int or a char or any other primitive data type, we can throw
a class.  There is a standard class that is usually throw, it is called <i>exception</i> and it is found
in the library called "exception". The class contains a virtual member function called
 "what". This function returns a null-terminated character sequence (char *).
You should create your own class that inherits from <i>exception</i>
and provides a specific implementation for the function 
what(). The function should return a string (char *) explaining what exception or error ocurred.
Here is an example similar to the above examples:


<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;exception&gt;
using namespace std;

class myExcept: public exception
{
  virtual const char* what() const throw()
  {
    return "Divide by zero error!\n";
  }
};

float divide(int a, int b )
{
  if (b == 0)
    {
      myExcept e;
      throw e;
    }
  else
    {
      return (float)a /b;
    }
}


int main()
{
  try {
    divide (7,0);
  }

  catch (exception &error)
    {
      cout &lt;&lt; error.what() &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  return 0;
}

</pre></blockquote>

<p> Note that I must use the reference parameter in my catch,
otherwise I will get a default exception, not the one I threw.
Also notice the use <code><b> const throw()</b></code> after the function prototype.
The <code>const</code> indicates that the function shall not change the instance 
for which it was called.  The <code>throw()</code> indicates that the function <i>what</i> 
is not permitted to itself throw any exceptions.
