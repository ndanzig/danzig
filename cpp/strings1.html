Now that you have learned what an array is, it should be clear that 
just as you can make an array of int's or float's, you can also make
an array of char's.  The special thing about an array of char's though,
is that an array of char's  is capable of storing words or sentences.
If you make an array of characters and then put a NULL at the end,
you have created a special array called a string.

<p>cin and cout are built to work with strings.  Any set of 
character literals inside quotation marks is automatically followed
by a NULL, so it is a string.  Let's see an example of the power of 
cin and cout.

<blockquote>
<tt>
<br>int main()
<br>{
<br>
<br>char ar[60]="greg";
<br>cout&lt;&lt;ar;
<br> ////  ar="hheeee"; //illegal
<br> cin &gt;&gt;ar;
<br> cout&lt;&lt;ar;
<br>
<br>  return 1;
<br>}
</tt>
</blockquote>

I can create an array of maximum 60 character (actually, while the array
has 60 spaces, I can only use 59 of them for letters because
I need one for a NULL)

<p>
Then I assign the array the literal string "greg".  (This can ONLY be done 
when the array is declared, not afterward.)

<p>Then I overwrite the array with whatever the user types in. (Note: If he types more than 59 character I will over-run my array.)

<p> Then I can print out the array.  Notice how cin and cout are smart enough 
to print the entire array when I give them the name of the array.
This will not work with and int or float array.  It only works with a NULL
terminated character array.
<hr>
<p>
Ok, now we have a string.  But since the string is actually just an array of 
characters I can mess around with it.  For example I can print the array 
in backward order.  First I will show you how to print it in forward order.
(This is actually what the function cout does when you give it an array name.



<blockquote>
<tt>
<br>int printString( char* myString )
<br>{
<br> for (int i = 0; myString[i] != NULL; i++)
<br>  &nbsp;  { cout&lt;&lt;myString[i];
<br>  &nbsp;  }
<br>  return 1;
<br>}
</tt>
</blockquote>


<p> This function starts at the beginning of the array it is passed and 
keeps printing out one letter at a time till it reaches the end of the array.
( remember string arrays always end with a NULL, so the NUll will be
my clue when the array is over.)

<p>To print the array backward I first have to find the end of the array.
So I will count till I get the end of the array and then work backward.
Let's see the example:



<blockquote>
<tt>
<br>int reversePrintString( char* myString )
<br>{
<br> for (int i = 0; myString[i] != NULL; i++);
<br> for (  ; i >= 0; --i)
<br>  &nbsp;  { cout&lt;&lt;myString[i];
<br>  &nbsp;  }
<br>  return 1;


<br>}
</tt>
</blockquote>

Notice that first I do a loop that does nothing except increment i till
it reaches the end of the array.  Then I in another loop I print the array
backward. 

<p>
I can also do other things, like, for example, find the first 'p' in the 
string. Or for example, <b>change</b> the original string by, say,
taking any lowercase t's in the array and making them into capital T's.
Let's see this example.

<blockquote>
<tt>
<br>int t_to_T( char* myString )
<br>{
<br> for (int i = 0; myString[i] != NULL; i++)
<br>  &nbsp;  {
<br> &nbsp;   &nbsp;  if (myString[i]=='t')
<br>   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp; { 
<br>   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  myString[i]='T';
<br>   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp; } 
<br>  &nbsp;  }
<br>  return 1;
<br>}
</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
As we explained in the section on arrays, the change made here will affect
the original array in the calling function.
And notice, I did not print out the string in the function.  I simply 
changed the string.  If I would want to print out the array I would
do that in the calling function, the main function for example:
<blockquote>
<tt>
<br>int main()
<br>{
<br> char charlie[100]="this is a test string.";
<br> t_to_T( charlie);
<br> cout&lt;&lt;charlie;
<br>  return 1;
<br>}
</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice that when I called t_to_T  I passed the name of my string, charlie.
I did not have to use the [ ] 's .
Also notice that the strng is much larger than it needs to be. 
This is ok, but I have wasted some 75 char's.
