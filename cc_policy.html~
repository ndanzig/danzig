<P>When a new account is requested for a staff member, the information I need 
is 
the following:  English first and last names, Teudat Zehoot number, 
preferred account name  (if they have a preference), contact staff 
member for me to get the account printout to (this would be either their 
boss or their secretary). 

<p>
For reasons of preserving high internet speed (in other words, finite budget
 for this resource) we
try to prevent non-critical, non-educational-related internet usage.  We are
 not really interested in being Big Brother, just using a finite resource 
efficiently.  We have found that an inordinate amount
of internet usage is taken up by entertainment activities such as watching 
videos, playing games and viewing sports pages.

We are sorry if our blocking policy  negatively effects you.

<p> Each user is assigned a global maximum disk usage (quota).  For staff 
members this is about 1 gigabyte. For students it is about 100 megabytes.
Within this space, the email inbox is limited to 30 megabytes.  The reason
for the small size of the email inbox is to prevent email and junk mail
from using up all your disk space.  If this would happen, then you would have 
real difficulties working.  Because of the limits in disk space, users must 
delete email which is unneeded and must also move email out
of the inbox into other folders.  Users should come up with a system of 
sorting incoming  email
 into folders that make sense for them.  Do not simply allow the inbox
to grow infinitely large.
 
<p> There is a maximal size allowed for sending emails.  Any email over 2 mb 
will almost certainly be rejected and bounced back.  Other reasons for
rejecting emails include if the email contains a virus, if it contains an 
executable file, if it contains more than 5 attachment.  If you are in need 
of sending a large email, you can post the file on our SSH site and 
send people a link to the site.  This will have the added advantages of
not filling the inbox of the recipient, the email getting 
 to the recipient faster, and the email system in general 
running better.
<p>
When you request some service from us or report a problem, we create a 
problem report.  We have the option of adding the
person who made the request (that's you) to the list of people who are 
informed when the problem report is updated.
You may therefore get email containing your problem report along with 
some comment from the CC staff for you to read. This comment should be near 
the bottom of the email.
