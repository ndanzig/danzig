<BR>
[This is a further journalistic entry concerning my fortuitous discovery in January, 2004, of cancer cells and my struggle with this shocking, new condition. Due to the twin<BR>
exigencies of accuracy and recuperation, there is an editorial delay of several weeks. As of May 20, 2004, I am resting at home.&nbsp; Phillip Danzig]<BR>

<BR>
MY G-D, THE SOUL YOU PLACED WITHIN ME IS PURE<BR>
<BR>
This is a prayer which Jews recite each morning, indicating, among other things, that the transcendental soul somehow differs from, but resides within, the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; A difficult concept to articulate.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, have any of us ever experienced a split, or discontinuity, between "body" and<BR>
"soul" ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An "out of body" experience ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Did we notice as we grew bigger or grew older ? Do we feel ourselves age ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Common sense seems to tell us, "My body is Me."<BR>
<BR>
But as my body reacted to the five solutions of toxic chemotherapy I had received, and then to the powerful drugs I was given to keep me from succumbing to an opportunistic infection,&nbsp; my body became less recognizable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I received so much saline solution [to flush out toxins] that my legs<BR>
and arms resembled Eddie Murphy's in "The Nutty Professor."&nbsp; My water changed color from yellow, to red, to cloudy yellow; settling on orange.&nbsp; I was tested by cysoscopy and told a fistula had opened up between my ileum and bladder.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would decide to move, drink water or, turn over, but nothing would happen; until I would FORCE myself to obey.&nbsp; I slept during the day and was startlingly awake at night.<BR>
<BR>
I continued to hiccup frequently,&nbsp; which was particularly unsettling since my father had spent the last three days of his life thus, some thirty years before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually I received thorazine and finally got some very sound, deep, drugged sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew gaunt and weak.&nbsp; Unshaven, I looked into a mirror and saw the scary, hollow eyed look of a very late Picasso self-portrait staring back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not trusted to shower myself, so, eventually, a nurse gave my body a sponge-bath, in bed.&nbsp; A humbling experience.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Yet my thoughts remained rational and energetic.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the early evening, I would telephone friends in the Southwest and then, in the dawn hours, speak to my children in Israel, or a friend in England or South Africa.&nbsp; But if I lay, half-comatose, during the afternoon and the phone rang, my mind would energize and I could easily hold a long conversation.&nbsp; The lower half of my body, plugged into the drip-drip of the intravenous feed, was responding to unknown, mysterious<BR>
forces; but my head, disengaged, above the neck, was sharp.<BR>
<BR>
I thought to myself,&nbsp; "My Mind is Me."<BR>
<BR>
Nausea, fortunately, was not a problem, but the sense that my body was subject to novel and unexpected changes was disturbing.&nbsp;&nbsp; My hair disappeared and my nails were growing at a furious rate:&nbsp; what might happen next ?&nbsp; The hospital sent a psychiatrist and we agreed that while I held<BR>
the usual, serious concerns about leaving my children and friends, I was less concerned about dying, as such, but much more troubled experiencing this loss of control.&nbsp; Of not knowing how my disease would "progress."&nbsp;&nbsp; Of how long, or, whether, it&nbsp; could be "cured."&nbsp; Of what strange symptom might appear next.&nbsp; Unlike the schedule of repairing a fractured knee or hip, nobody knew.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
I am no stranger to hospitals.&nbsp; I had had two childhood surgeries:&nbsp; appendicitis and tonsillectomy. As an adult I had an ileitis resection, surgical removal of an abscess and placement of a stint near my kidneys [utera]. I am familiar with hospitals, and even enjoy the opportunity of breaking the routine of schooling or work.&nbsp;&nbsp; But a voyage through a hospital without a reliable chart or compass is another matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oncologists do not like to make promises.<BR>
<BR>
Yet, if I couldn't get a handle on my body, I could and did direct my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked questions and learned much more about cancer and different treatments. I read "The anatomy of Hope," by Dr. Jerome Groopman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began to read the Psalms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I paid special attention to the prayer:<BR>
<BR>
Blessed are you, Hashem, our G-d, King of the Universe,<BR>
Who fashioned man with wisdom and created within him <BR>
many openings and many cavities. <BR>
It is obvious and known that if but one of them were to be ruptured or but one of them were to be blocked, <BR>
it would be impossible to survive <BR>
and to stand before your Throne of Glory. <BR>
.<BR>
Blessed are you, Hashem, who heals all flesh and acts wondrously.<BR>
<BR>
In this, I found comfort.<BR>
