<BR>
Where the Tuscan sun is warm and fair<BR>
Lives a Maid with a flower in her hair.<BR>
Although her name is unknown to fame<BR>
Still I love her just the same !<BR>

Mirianina Tra-la-la<BR>
Mirianina Tra-la-la.<BR>
Oh, Mirianina<BR>
Oh, Mirianina<BR>
That wild red rose, <BR>
with poppies in her hair.</FONT></HTML>
