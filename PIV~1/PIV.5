THE POISON I.V. PAPERS:  Five

[This concerns my Doctor’s fortuitous discovery in January, 2004, of cancer 
cells and my struggle with this shocking, new condition. Due to the twin 
exigencies of accuracy and
recuperation, there is an editorial delay of several weeks.  As of June 6, 
2004, I am alive and resting at home. If you have missed any of this series, 
please request them.    Phillip Danzig]


PERFORM NO HARM

This is the first ‘commandment’ of the ancient Hippocratic Oath.  “Who was 
the Doctor,” I wondered, “who initially fed poison to his patient on the risky 
theory that this might cure him ?”  The patient must have been desperate; the 
doctor must have been desperate.  

It turns out that general Radiation has been used on cancer before 
Chemotherapy, and that this followed other
desperate remedies, such as using arsenic to treat syphilis.  Sometimes the ‘
cure is worse than the disease;’ other times, there is no choice.

Although my ten-day sojourn in the “Five East” Suite of the Lutheran Medical 
Center, Brooklyn, was totally unexpected, it was not an entire misery.   I 
held long, satisfying talks with some nurses and my new roommate late at night.  
 “John” summed up one discussion of ethics by mentioning Philo of Alexander: 
 'Be kind to all you meet, they are fighting a great battle,' he quoted.

I found many things to laugh and kid about, such as the time a Nurse 
Technician, taking my vital signs at mid-night, asked me for my hand, and I told her, “
Look, I’ve been married and divorced, and am not about to try that again.”   
This, she found amusing.

Sitting in a chair one day, I watched as the Housekeeper made up my bed.   
Finished, she told me, 'Now, go and lie down.’  Exhausted, I replied, “If I had 
enough strength to go and lie down, do you think I would be sitting here in 
this hospital ?”

I was anemic and my heart was racing, even as I lay flat in bed, often, for 
hours.  So I wondered:  At the end of life, each of our hearts would have 
beaten a finite number of times.  Shouldn’t they low mine down somehow, to live the 
longer ?

> “Can’t you at least stop my hiccups ?” I finally blurt out, exhausted.   ‘
> Well,’ comes the reply, ‘my patients never hiccup.’  And then to awaken,

> A doctor said, 'You came in undernourished and now we have put some weight

> I’ve got no strings

> To make me fret
> Or make me frown

> I had strings
> But now I’m free
> There are no strings on me
