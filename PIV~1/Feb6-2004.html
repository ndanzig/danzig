<BR>
I was seen by a highly recommended oncologist today, and he has been rather reassuring.&nbsp; Dr. Howard Bruckner is a highly reputable, kindly and well-known published specialist and has created several new protocols in the field and has had some amazing successes.&nbsp; He was recommended to me by Rabbi Meir Fund [or, I to him ?] and my Gerontologist at NY University Medical had good things to say about him, as did my contact at Memorial Sloan-Kettering [Lew].<BR>
<BR>
In brief, this is what he said:<BR>
<BR>
He is 'not impressed' by the masses in my liver: meaning, he's seen much worse and believes mine can be handled.&nbsp; This was very reassuring to me.<BR>
<BR>
He feels that Dr. Groisser, my Crohn's doctor, has done a thoroughly professional job in trying to track down the primary site.&nbsp; He sees no need to repeat any of this.&nbsp; This also eased my mind.<BR>
<BR>
He believes [as does Dr. Groisser] that either the small bowl [27 feet long] or the pancreas [a carrot-like organ] is involved.&nbsp; The good news is, that either/both of these are treated by the very same protocols [chemotherapy] and that they will respond to treatment, as will the liver.<BR>
<BR>
He feels, therefore, that determining exactly which of the organs is the original site amounts to an unnecessary delay, so I may decide NOT to go to Memorial Sloan-Kettering for further analysis, after all.&nbsp; [I have an appointment there for next Thursday.]<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Bruckner will consult with Dr. Groisser and treatment may start next week, after I return from Florida.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing good health, safety, prosperity and happiness to all,<BR>
<BR>
