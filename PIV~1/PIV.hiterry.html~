<BR>
I have now done three chemo sessions, and in general the effects hae been not very painful.&nbsp; No nausea to speak of !&nbsp; no headaches !&nbsp; But I do get some strange effects, mainly a tiredness, a weariness, for a day or two, and then I feel okay.&nbsp; Then sleep for ten hours.&nbsp; Weird !&nbsp; I find staring at the ceiling is an interesting pastime.<BR>
<BR>
Plus some mouth fungus, some finger tingling, some stomach sensitivity,&nbsp;&nbsp; Some days a good appetite, other nadia.&nbsp; It like there is inconsistency inside my body from one day to the next.&nbsp; I've never experienced anything like this.&nbsp; I am slightly getting use to it, I guesses.&nbsp; "One day at at time,' as they say.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
My friends are still calling and wishing me well, willing to shop and visit, at a reduced pace&nbsp; ++ which is fine ++ although I am lucky enough to have a Home Health aid assigned to me fire days a week, four hours.&nbsp; {Breakfast, shoppng and lunch.]&nbsp; she leaves and I go to sleep, generally.&nbsp; But I went to a movie last week {I would highly recommend NOT TO SEE, Ladykillers,' a two-dimensional, cartoon which is&nbsp; redeemed only slights byTom Hanks.]<BR>
<BR>
I will go to two Seders in the neighborhood, close to home, rather than visit Rabbi Myer Fund in Brooklyn, who has been very supportive of my illness.&nbsp; Too much of a stretch, Brooklyn.&nbsp; My schedule seems to be one Thurdsy-Friday I do a 24 hour infusion {Poison I.V.] and then, next week, I go in Thursday for a blood count.&nbsp; These blood counts&nbsp; But I'm thinking of asking them to skip this Thursday's chemo as the Sedar festivities will put a strain on me.<BR>
<BR>
My third son [from Israel] plans to visit soon and an old girlfriend will be here May 12 - 19.&nbsp; Except for the illness, this has been a remarkablely positive, interesting and&nbsp; supportive and happy period in my life.&nbsp; I have a purpose in life.. .. ..<BR>
<BR>
And, I have&nbsp; become closer to HaShem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each day I awaken I am so thankful.&nbsp; I thank you for your support.&nbsp; I hope and pray that the troubles in you family are improving and you share manty bright, happy times&nbsp; ahead. Love,&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil<BR>
