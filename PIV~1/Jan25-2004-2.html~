<BR>
I just sent a more detailed account of my situation to Gavriel, and I will use the same explanation as I sent to him to both of you.&nbsp; Please excuse this simplification of effort, but it makes sense to me.&nbsp; Most of all, I want each of you to have the SAME information.<BR>
<BR>
What I am about to write is not easy to write, and will not be easy to read.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I did not perhaps fully explain before is that Dr. Groisser had ordered a CAT scan for me when I began a new treatment with Remicade, an infusion, about ten months ago.&nbsp; That CAT scan was relatively 'normal.'&nbsp;&nbsp; But then, as my stomach pains persisted he thought that there were new problems with my Ileitis [Crohn's] and no doubt there are.&nbsp; So last week he ordered another CAT scan.<BR>
<BR>
But what he [fortuitously ? ] found was a problem with my liver.&nbsp; Foreign masses/growths in the liver, to be exact. <BR>
<BR>
These could be considered tiny tumors.&nbsp; They compared this with the previous CAT scan done at the start of the Remicade treatment but the liver had shown no abnormality then [thank G-d].&nbsp; This problem, then, is recent.&nbsp; The question now is, did these masses originate in the liver [which would be easier to remove] or elsewhere ?&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
A biopsy was done Thursday and a preliminary diagnoses Friday, said, unfortunately, that the origin lies elsewhere: either in my colon or esophagus.&nbsp; Colon cancer is always a potential eventual complication for Crohn's disease, but it can be treated.&nbsp; Dr. Groisser has performed a colonoscopy annually or biannually on me for several years, now.&nbsp; Spreading to the liver is a further possible complication, and now seems likely.&nbsp; But it, too, can be treated.<BR>
<BR>
Monday I go for additional tests as to the origin of the cells, because different cells are treated differently, according to origin, even if they travel to the liver.<BR>
<BR>
I find all of this rather shocking, to say the least, as I have grown used to being in good health, other than my Crohn's [an inflammation of the small bowel].&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
But I will transfer my case ASAP to New York University Hospital or Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which have the absolutely best departments in this field in the world.&nbsp; I have consulted with several secondary doctors already, as this is my big effort/interest of course, just now.<BR>
<BR>
One would like to 'spare' close loved-ones from such news, but there is no point in that, I guess. I do not know the survival rate, and I suppose there are many individual factors affecting a cure beyond mere statistical ones, anyway.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
If you have any questions please let me know.&nbsp; I appreciate being in contact with you and hearing from you.<BR>
<BR>
Much love,&nbsp; Dad<BR>
