THE POISON I.V. PAPERS:  IV

[This is a further journalistic entry concerning my fortuitous discovery in 
January, 2004, of cancer cells and my struggle with this shocking, new 
condition. Due to the twin
exigencies of accuracy and recuperation, there is an editorial delay of 
several weeks. As of May 20, 2004, I am resting at home.  Phillip Danzig]


MY G-D, THE SOUL YOU PLACED WITHIN ME IS PURE

This is a prayer which Jews recite each morning, indicating, among other 
things, that the transcendental soul somehow differs from, but resides within, the 
body.   A difficult concept to articulate.   After all, have any of us ever 
experienced a split, or discontinuity, between ‘body’ and
‘soul’ ?    An ‘out of body’ experience ?   Did we notice as we grew bigger 
or grew older ? Do we feel ourselves age ?   Common sense seems to tell us, “
My body is Me.”

But as my body reacted to the five solutions of toxic chemotherapy I had 
received, and then to the powerful drugs I was given to keep me from succumbing to 
an opportunistic infection,  my body became less recognizable.    I received 
so much saline solution [to flush out toxins] that my legs
and arms resembled Eddie Murphy’s in ‘The Nutty Professor.’  My water 
changed color from yellow, to red, to cloudy yellow; settling on orange.  I was 
tested by cysoscopy and told a fistula had opened up between my ileum and bladder. 
  I would decide to move, drink water or, turn over, but nothing would 
happen; until I would FORCE myself to obey.  I slept during the day and was 
startlingly awake at night.

I continued to hiccup frequently,  which was particularly unsettling since my 
father had spent the last three days of his life thus, some thirty years 
before.   Eventually I received thorazine and finally got some very sound, deep, 
drugged sleep.   I grew gaunt and weak.  Unshaven, I looked into a mirror and 
saw the scary, hollow eyed look of a very late Picasso self-portrait staring 
back.   I was not trusted to shower myself, so, eventually, a nurse gave my body 
a sponge-bath, in bed.  A humbling experience.  

Yet my thoughts remained rational and energetic.   During the early evening, 
I would telephone friends in the Southwest and then, in the dawn hours, speak 
to my children in Israel, or a friend in England or South Africa.  But if I 
lay, half-comatose, during the afternoon and the phone rang, my mind would 
energize and I could easily hold a long conversation.  The lower half of my body, 
plugged into the drip-drip of the intravenous feed, was responding to unknown, 
mysterious
forces; but my head, disengaged, above the neck, was sharp.

I thought to myself,  “My Mind is Me.”

Nausea, fortunately, was not a problem, but the sense that my body was 
subject to novel and unexpected changes was disturbing.   My hair disappeared and my 
nails were growing at a furious rate:  what might happen next ?  The hospital 
sent a psychiatrist and we agreed that while I held
the usual, serious concerns about leaving my children and friends, I was less 
concerned about dying, as such, but much more troubled experiencing this loss 
of control.  Of not knowing how my disease would ‘progress.’   Of how long, 
or, whether, it  could be ‘cured.’  Of what strange symptom might appear 
next.  Unlike the schedule of repairing a fractured knee or hip, nobody knew.    

I am no stranger to hospitals.  I had had two childhood surgeries:  
appendicitis and tonsillectomy. As an adult I had an ileitis resection, surgical 
removal of an abscess and placement of a stint near my kidneys [utera]. I am 
familiar with hospitals, and even enjoy the opportunity of breaking the routine of 
schooling or work.   But a voyage through a hospital without a reliable chart or 
compass is another matter.   Oncologists do not like to make promises.

Yet, if I couldn’t get a handle on my body, I could and did direct my mind.   
I asked questions and learned much more about cancer and different 
treatments. I read ‘The anatomy of Hope,’ by Dr. Jerome Groopman.    I began to read 
the Psalms.    And I paid special attention to the prayer:

Blessed are you, Hashem, our G-d, King of the Universe,
Who fashioned man with wisdom and created within him 
many openings and many cavities. 
It is obvious and known that if but one of them were to be ruptured or but 
one of them were to be blocked, 
it would be impossible to survive 
and to stand before your Throne of Glory. 
.
Blessed are you, Hashem, who heals all flesh and acts wondrously.

In this, I found comfort.
