<BR>
Just to put it in black and white, I am not suffering every day, day in and day out.&nbsp; In fact, my chemo reaction seems to be milder than what many others report:&nbsp; I am 'lucky' or, blessed.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
I also learned that since my intervals between chemo infusions had been extended, from time to time, does not mean tht I have 'lost time' by not receiving the next infusion 'on time.'&nbsp; Rather, I was told that the delay means that the chemo was Still Working.&nbsp; So I have NOT lost time.<BR>
<BR>
It is now about ten days since the new infusion [through wrist and liver] and I am having a mild reaction, Thank G-d.&nbsp; Hopefully, Iwill receive&nbsp; # 2&nbsp; nest week.<BR>

I have been keeping busy, and out of trouble.&nbsp; Thursday I met with&nbsp; Kathy [formerly Philips] and Jim [her new husband of 10 years] and suggested afternoon tea at the Waldorf Astoria.&nbsp; It was delightful and fun !&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Saturday I violated my 'one thing a day' dictum, and loved it !&nbsp; I&nbsp; A] went to services at shul, then&nbsp;&nbsp; B]&nbsp; I was invited to a birthday party for my old New Jersey friend, Andrea Green, by her son Keith, an architect who asked me especially to be there.&nbsp; Although I Have NOT been in contact with her for a year or so, I went along, for 'old times sake.'&nbsp;&nbsp; The small party was given at the cafe of the Whitney Museum, and I met some of her old boyfriends.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Weird.]&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
C]&nbsp; Then, in the evening, my old C&amp;C school friend Fritz Kraber invited me to the ABT 'Don Quixote' Ballet at the Met.&nbsp; Couldn't refuse.&nbsp; I slept for an hour B 4 the start.&nbsp; Wonderful, and I am sure that Tzar Nicholas would have enjoyed the choreography.&nbsp; Fritz was in from Austin&nbsp; TX, where he teaches music, and I only see him, and wife Joan, once a year.&nbsp; All in all, exhausting but worth it.<BR>
<BR>
Needless to say, I slept most of the next day, all day.&nbsp; But James and I had supper together&nbsp; [fish and chips].&nbsp; I rested, and my belly was full.&nbsp; James leaves for England Wednesday, and I am throwing a 'gathering' on Tuesday evening&nbsp; [mostly for a few friends and the Chavurah group] to see him off.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Hope you are enjoying yourseves and that you all are well, receiving abundant benefits both spiritually and materially, and a good slice of joy </BLOCKQUOTE>!</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FACE="RomanFixedWidth" LANG="0"><BR>
