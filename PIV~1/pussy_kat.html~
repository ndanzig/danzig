<h2> Riddle of the Sphinx</h2>
When you met me you didn't meet me <br>
When you knew me you didn't know me -- <br>
I did not know myself.
<p>
When I met you I could see you, <br>
Hear you, smell you, softly feel you -- <br>
I had no feeling of myself.
<p>
So I held on, couldn't release you<br>
Bore inside you, would become you --<br>
More important than myself.
<p>
When I hurt you, confused you, used you<br>
I hurt and lost myself.<br>
So I left you by yourself.
<p>
Now I circle, coldly coasting,<br> 
travel quickly, twisting, searching,<br>
Collecting pieces of myself.
<p>
I hope someday I won't need you:<br>
Only want you -- have something for you --<br>
My feeling, knowing, loving self.
