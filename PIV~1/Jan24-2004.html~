<BR>
Did I ever answer this ?&nbsp; It takes me a while to react to architectural designs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like the proposed memorial design rather much.&nbsp; Two pools representing the 'footprint' of the buildings, some surrounding waterfalls to bring some gentle movement and sound into the place:&nbsp; people always like water.&nbsp; [We are composed 85% of water, after all.. .. ..]<BR>
<BR>
Then some quiet places for the mourners.&nbsp; Hopefully these will be watched and NOT vandalized.&nbsp; Public spaces in NYC that are shut off can be dangerous.&nbsp; The surrounding retaining walls [which kept out the Hudson River in the WTC] will be left and exposed.&nbsp; They are an engineering marvel, and should be exposed.&nbsp; They were designed by the son of a woman in my congregation, she tells me.&nbsp; {Almost every week.. .. ..]<BR>
<BR>
I also like a tall tower, with a 'spire' going up 1776 feet.&nbsp; Neat touch by the architect, Leibeshold {Spell ?].&nbsp; Nice to have one of the tribe involved, isn't it ?<BR>
<BR>
What is your opinion, and others in Israel ?<BR>
<BR>
At this point, I am hoping to be with Henry when you visit:&nbsp; Henry says that there is no&nbsp; problem about this with Myrna..<BR>
<BR>
Love,&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad<BR>

I heard they are also planning to build new towers there, the highest in <BR>
the world.&nbsp; Do you know anything about this?<BR>
