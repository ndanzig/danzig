<br>
Lucas attended the ORT Careers Course at Johannesburg ORT in 2001 and the Gensec Mosaic course in 2002. 
 
<p> 
 

Lucas comes from Soweto. He dropped out of university due to lack of funds and spent the next five years looking for work. This is his story:
<p>
"I studied a six weeks basic computer literacy skills course with ORT SA in 2001. It was during this course that my teacher, Mr Gerry Levy, discovered that I have artistic abilities with a programme called Microsoft Power Point.
<p>
In March 2002 I was recalled to study mosaic art in a course presented by an international mosaicist from New York by the name of Joshua Phillip Danzig. Since then I have been doing mosaic with ORT SA and I am now a trainer for CICI (Creative Inner City Initiative) - an empowerment project training young adults in the art of mosaic.
<p>
I would like to thank ORT SA for the passage that leads to a role they have opened for me. Because I can now easily transfer the skill to the unemployed so that they can become self-sufficient."
<p>
Lucas also creates and markets his mosaics successfully to local shops and has recently signed a contract with a company that will market his works internationally.

<h2>Mosaic Benches Face Unseating At Grant's Tomb </h2>
<br>

<p>
To some critics and many local residents, the colorful mosaic tile benches that snake around Grant's Tomb in Riverside Park at 122d Street are a pleasing example of folk art, a cherished expression of community involvement. But to some Civil War buffs and the National Park Service, which maintains the monument, they clash with the site and trivialize its historical significance. 
<p>

With the 100th anniversary celebration of the monument scheduled for April 27, the Park Service is intent on removing the benches as part of a $1.6 million renovation that began in 1995. Last Monday, workers for the Park Service cut one piece from a bench and hoisted it a few inches to test how difficult the seats would be to move. Then they lowered it back into place. This experiment galvanized local officials, preservationists, artists and others who began writing letters, passing out petitions and vowing to fight the benches' removal. 
<p>
''We were discussing chaining ourselves to the benches,'' said a member of the Morningside Heights Historic District Committee, Michael Gotkin, adding that his group may file a lawsuit against the Park Service, on the ground that removing the benches would violate citizens' right to freedom of speech and expression. ''They have no legal right to do this because it is a work of art,'' Mr. Gotkin said. The fate of the benches is to be discussed at a public meeting of Community Board 9 on Thursday. 
<p>
Commissioned 25 years ago by the Park Service, in part to discourage people from scribbling graffiti on the monument, the benches were designed by the artist Pedro Silva and the architect Phillip Danzig, and were made with the help of hundreds of local adults and children. With references to the Civil War and an undulating, continuous shape, they have been compared to an unfolding comic book. ''The benches gave the community a sense of ownership and belonging,'' said Tsipi Ben-Haim, the executive director of City Arts, a nonprofit group that sponsored the project and other public art projects. ''What brought the people to the tomb are the benches, not the tomb.'' 
<p>
But the Manhattan Superintendent for the National Park Service, Joseph T. Avery, said he thinks that placing the benches around the monument was a mistake. Some descendants of General Grant have also said the benches are inappropriate. ''We've spent a lot of money in the last three years rehabbing the monument and the plaza,'' Mr. Avery said. ''We want to restore it to its original intent.'' 
<p>
He also said that the benches would be reassembled somewhere in the city park system, but Ms. Ben-Haim argued that ''to take them anywhere would be to destroy them.'' 
<p>
''You can't change your mind,'' she said, ''when people put their souls into something.'' 
<p>
The executive director of the Riverside Park Fund, James Dowell, and other local officials said that one alternative proposed is moving the benches to the Claremont section of the park, although this would require a complex and costly approval process because the park is landmarked to 125th Street, ''You can't just pick them up and move them tomorrow,'' Mr. Dowell said. ''The mosaics have been there for 25 years. They have a tradition themselves that can't be ignored.''<br> JANET ALLON

New York's Master Plan: Carving Up the Turkey</a> </h2>

To the Editor:
<br> 
It was more with dismay than anger that I read William Barrett's "Frank Lloyd Wright's Pictorama"  [March]. . . .
<p>
Mr. Barrett is simply mistaken when he asserts what he takes to be 
"the key to the whole structure. He [Wright] imagined a great crown continuously and slowly flowing past the pictures"
<p>

In reality, of course, Mr. Wright planned the museum for 350 persons and the occupancy requirements were only subsequently enlarged.
<p>
Mention is made of the artificial light within the museum. . . . Mr. Wright in fact provided an ingenious lighting scheme, relying upon sunlight, which (rightly or wrongly) was abandoned in favor of artificial light by the director of the museum.
<p>
Basic confusion between what Mr. Wright designed and what Mr. Sweeney (the director) altered has resulted in criticism of the lack of seating, or the lack of smaller spaces where
"individual works of art could be isolated and looked at."
 Even a cursory investigation of Mr. Wright's presentation drawings would reveal the flexible partition system he designed for this purpose. . . .

<p>
But the most disappointing feature about the article is its lack of sympathy
 [and of the] respect and tolerance for the 
"spiritual and individual personality of the modern artist"
 which Mr. Barrett eloquently supports, unless, apparently, that artist happens to be an architect.

      Historical article clear and informative

      The whole first century cultural scene is important, but foreign to those educated 
      in secular institutions. This article makes clear some of the important events, in
      an understandable way, with emphasis on how attitudes and events related to each 
      other and what their signifince to today might be. 

      Cool water for a thirsty mind !
