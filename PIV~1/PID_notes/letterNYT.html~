To the Editor: 

Your April 1 three-column photo of Grant's Tomb, with your article on souvenirs, helps restore America's mausoleum to its rightful prominence on the highest point of land in Manhattan. Plans are under way by the National Park Service to renovate the building for its 100th anniversary in 1997, and the colorful tile benches surrounding the site will be restored this summer. 

We at CityArts Inc., producers of the mosaic bench in 1972, will round up as many of the original 2,000 artists, neighborhood volunteers and visitors as we can find. They will refinish aged sections, make minor structural repairs and give the benches new life. Sponsorship by State Senator Franz Leichter is assured, and we will make available postcards, T-shirts and other souvenirs of the spirited bench designs.
