THE POISON I.V. PAPERS: II.<BR>
<BR>
[This is the second of a series of occasional journalistic entries concerning<BR>
the recent fortuitous discovery of cancer cells in my abdomen, and my struggle<BR>
to put this shocking, new condition into perspective. The presentation will be<BR>
honest and in my own particular style. Phillip Danzig]<BR>
<BR>
April 28 , 2004
I prepared for the consultation with Dr. Bruckner.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
It is my practice to seek the opinions of others, and I received a diverse and ambiguous spectrum<BR>
of comment::&nbsp;&nbsp; Go with the most highly recommended doctor you can find;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only select a<BR>
physician with whom you can communicate;&nbsp; The patient's attitude is the major factor, so be<BR>
positive, dress well so your doctor will take your case seriously;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your attitude doesn't count for<BR>
much, its all in the diagnosis and medication;&nbsp; Take a holistic approach and eat the proper organic<BR>
foods;&nbsp; Don't listen to what others tell you, for in the end, you are responsible for the management of your disease.<BR>
<BR>
Bearing a large, 20 In. by 30 In. carrying case containing my CAT scans, Reports and liver<BR>
biopsy, I traveled by subway out to 53rd Street in 'Sunset Park,' Brooklyn to the Lutheran<BR>
Medical Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked through a blue-collar residential area, under the Brooklyn Queens<BR>
Expressway and into a forlorn Industrial Park that has seen better days.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Medical Center is<BR>
housed in a large, 6 story industrial building undergoing continuous renovation and repairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its<BR>
long hallways were unusually clean and shiny, even for a hospital.&nbsp; 'Five East,' the oncology<BR>
ward, is carpeted and has Van Gogh prints on the walls.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Bruckner is a stout man, with a close salt and pepper beard who rarely wears the white lab<BR>
coat common to his profession.&nbsp; I gave him a sheet listing my priorities:&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cure liver cancer<BR>
<BR>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate, cure primary cancer<BR>
<BR>
3.&nbsp; Maintain control over my Crohn's disease<BR>
<BR>
4.&nbsp; Use modern pain management for chemotherapy side effects<BR>
<BR>
5.&nbsp; Note possible urinary tract inflammation<BR>
<BR>
6.&nbsp; Maintain nutritional management for my weight loss:&nbsp; from 147 lb. to 117 lb. in one year<BR>
<BR>
7.&nbsp; Many fistulas are said to be present<BR>
<BR>
Then I listed my five previous surgical operations and gave some biographical information,<BR>
including that I am a retired architect and mosaic artist.<BR>
Dr. Bruckner read the paper and said, "This is a competent list:&nbsp; I ought to have you lecture my<BR>
class in patient communication."<BR>
<BR>
I seemed to have caught his attention.<BR>
<BR>
Next, Dr. Bruckner went over the CAT scans, Reports and liver biopsy I brought, but seemed<BR>
mainly interested in the liver X-ray. He held it up to the overhead fluorescent lights in the ceiling<BR>
saying,&nbsp; "I've seen worse...."<BR>
<BR>
Feeling relieved, I mentioned that I had heard that he had taken on a 92 year-old patient with<BR>
pancreatic cancer on whom several other doctors had given up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard that she had lived<BR>
another five years !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn't mind living another five years, I told him&nbsp; "I have several such<BR>
cases," he replied.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We discussed the absence of knowing the organ of origin, but the doctor<BR>
reassured me.&nbsp;&nbsp; "The origin is either in the small intestines or the pancreas, and I treat both<BR>
malignancies the same way.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's not worth the time lost for further testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use an<BR>
aggressive approach, using five chemicals,"&nbsp; he said.<BR>
<BR>
Sensing that I was in the hands of a confident physician, I stood up and we shook hands.&nbsp; An<BR>
appointment was made for the first chemo infusion to begin a week later.<BR>
<BR>
"Forget about the five years for the older woman,"&nbsp; I said, "I will be looking to be here at 97 !"<BR>
<BR>
I liked what I had seen of Dr. Bruckner, but kept my appointment with Dr. Ki Young Chung at<BR>
Memorial Sloan-Kettering, for a second opinion.&nbsp; I had been told Sloan-Kettering was steep<BR>
into research, considering its patients as statistical specimens.&nbsp; Located on 53rd street, Manhattan,<BR>
in the heart of "Bloomingdale Country,"its "minimalist" architectural decor was as far from<BR>
Lutheran as could be imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Chung is a warm and patient profession, completing a four<BR>
year Fellowship at Sloan-Kettering.&nbsp; I asked where he had studied before that and&nbsp; he replied,<BR>
Johns-Hopkins, Baltimore.&nbsp; A thorough man, he had already read my CAT scans, Reports and<BR>
liver biopsy before he called me into his office.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
He pointed out that my work-up was almost complete, but there was another test which could,<BR>
possibly, determine if the pancreas was involved.&nbsp; "How efficacious is this test ?" I asked.&nbsp; "It is<BR>
clearly determinative only 25% of the time."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mentioned seeing Dr. Bruckner, who had said<BR>
that the test was not worth the delay.&nbsp; Dr. Chung did not comment.&nbsp; I said that Dr. Bruckner<BR>
planned to give me a slow infusion of five different medications.&nbsp;&nbsp; "All at once,?" he questioned. <BR>
"Yes," told him, then asked, "What does the literature say about using five at once ?"&nbsp; There is<BR>
nothing in the literature on using five chemo medications at once," he said.&nbsp; "Our approach is to<BR>
use two or three at one time.&nbsp; If they don't help, we move on to others."&nbsp; Then Dr. Chung gave<BR>
me a short, but complete, physical examination:&nbsp; chest, heart, belly, ears throat, weight and height.&nbsp; <BR>
I noted that no doctor had taken my height in about 20 years, and realized with some small shock<BR>
that I had shrunken an inch and a half in that time !<BR>
<BR>
So I had a choice:&nbsp; continuing with Dr. Bruckner, off 53rd Street, Brooklyn, or change to Dr.<BR>
Chung, on 53rd Street, Manhattan.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to stay with Dr. Bruckner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FACE="RomanFixedWidth" LANG="0"><BR>
