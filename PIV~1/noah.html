face=RomanFixedWidth lang=0 size=2 PTSIZE="10">Dear Shay<BR><BR>Thank you for 
your note.&nbsp; <BR><BR>I am so very happy that you can use Noah's drafting 
tools.&nbsp; I do NOT know much about Noah Berkofski. He was an older, dignified 
man when I met him, when I was about your age [1948] !&nbsp; He had been 
teaching at a Technical School in Prague, but managed to survive the Nazi 
invasion.<BR><BR><BR>The family of my mother [Hilda Berman Danzig] had changed 
their name from Berkofsky around 1880 when they immigrated to America.&nbsp; But 
their cousins [Noah's family] obviously, did NOT go to America at that time, 
unfortunately, and were destroyed during the war.<BR><BR>Noah was a dignified 
man, of the European 'old school.'&nbsp; Very polite manners, wore a hat outside 
and a tie inside at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke English with a foreign 
accent. But then, again, he also probably spoke four or five languages with an 
accent ! !&nbsp; {Czechoslovakian, Austrian, French, Yiddish, Hebrew, German, 
Russian and English.]<BR><BR>My mother would see him once or twice a year [she 
was a good hostess] and he lived in New York, probably until around 1960.&nbsp; 
I have a picture of him with his Technical students in Prague:&nbsp; a well 
dressed man of the time, with a special look in his eye.&nbsp; I am sorry I did 
not get to know him better, but am glad that some memory of him lives on, now, 
with you.<BR><BR>I hope you enjoy using these precision instruments in your 
drafting class, but remember: the humidity in Florida is NOT good for metal 
instruments, so try to keep them sealed in a&nbsp; tight air-free bag [like a 
sealable sandwich bag] if you can.&nbsp; A light wiping with a thin oil would 
also help.<BR><BR>E N J O Y!<BR><BR>Love, <BR><BR>Grandpa
