American Presidents<BR>
<B>C - SPAN  </B><BR>
<BR>
GREETINGS!<BR>
<BR>
	You must have considered including the extensive, 440 foot-long mosaic-tile memorial tile bench situated <B>at the General Grant National Memorial, </B>New York City, in your program of July 12.<BR>
<BR>
	Although just about as controversial, locally, as the presidency of General Grant himself, the bench was created over 25 years ago (1972-3) and includes refer- ences to the life of Grant, including his <B>four **** star </B>Generalship, his founding of the National Park Service, and his triumphal World-Wide tour, following his Presidency.<BR>
<BR>
	The bench was created as a community art project and has been highly lauded by the <B>American Institutes of Architects </B>and other professional agencies.    However, in keeping with many crosscurrents in the United States, numerous individuals have been opposed to this project, and periodically agitate for its removal.   These groups represent the Civil War Roundtable, certain members of the General's descendants (but not all) and some anti- quarians.<BR>
<BR>
	But as <B>Jerry Nadler, the Congressman </B>of this District has said,  the Civil War was based on controversy, this nation's experiment in Democracy thrives in controversy and debate, so it is fitting that such a discussion exists.   It can only serve to bring important attention to the now unfortunately ignored site and to some little-discussed issues of the Civil War, such as the real effects of Recon- struction and the missed opportunities.<BR>
<BR>
	I have complete documentation on the building of the bench, and on the two (2) major political attacks designed to remove it, the most recent in 1997.  I know the history of its building (having been the architect on the site during construction and helped guide its design)  and currently live in New York City.<BR>
<BR>
	If you've any questions or need for additional inform- ation, documentation, or anecdotes, please do not hesitate to contact me.<BR>
