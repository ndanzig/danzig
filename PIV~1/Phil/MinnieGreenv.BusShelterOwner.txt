RE:   Minnie Green  v. City of Newark, NJ Transit et Alr

In December of 1998, you sent me two photographs illustrating the location at which your client, Ms. Minnie Green, is said to have fallen or tripped on a stub of a breakaway pipe (or sign pole) indicating bus information.    The accident is said to have occurred at or near the intersection of Orange and Roseville Avenues, Newark on August 20, 1996.

The photos, taken after the accident, show the end of a derelect bus shelter (end panels missing) and a square patch of dirt (possibly for a tree) and a relatively new replacement pipe, or, sign pole.   Ad-   jacent curbs and sidewalk pavers appear to be in poor repair.

It is clear that any protrusion of a pipe, sign pole or other vertical element standing more than 3/4 In. above the adjacent surface of the ground or sidewalk constitutes a hazard, and is the apparent cause of the  alledged accidnet.   It is the responsibility of any party which builds or erects any structure on a public sidewalk, or pedestrian path, to keep same in good repair at all times.  If such becomes an impediment to the normal flow of traffic,or to the normal use of the area,  it must be removed.  Otherwise, the responsible party is liable to all claims by persons so injured.

If you have need of further discussion or reports, please contact my office.

Sincerely
