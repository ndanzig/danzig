<P align=left>Introduction to the Economicus (Nihul Habayit)</P></FONT>
<P align=left>The <I>Economicus</I> is a guide to the art (or science) of 
household management, one of the most desirable arts a free man in ancient 
Greece could wish to acquire (see <I>Protagoras</I> 319a). It is filled with 
practical advice on organizing one&rsquo;s household and making a respectable 
living in fourth century Greece. In this sense it belongs to the classical 
tradition of advice-literature, a genre which includes such works as 
Hesiod&rsquo;s <I>Works and Days</I>, Virgil&rsquo;s <I>Georgics</I>, and even 
Ovid&rsquo;s <I>Art of Love</I>. It contains advice on subjects such as how to 
organize one&rsquo;s utensils and clothing, proper methods for turning the soil, 
and even offers some beauty tips for wives. It also includes valuable advice on 
inspiring devoted service from one&rsquo;s domestic servants. The work is of 
historical value because it provides rare information about the daily life of 
ancient Greeks, and in particular about women. We learn about the roles of women 
and men in the Greek household, about relations between masters and servants 
within the home, and, of course, about Greek agricultural practices.</P>
<P align=left>But there are several features of the work which make it difficult 
to conclude that it is really nothing more than a manual of practical household 
advise. For one thing, the advice is presented in the form of a dialogue. In 
general, when Xenophon had practical advice to offer, he used a non-dialogical 
form (see <I>The Cavalry Commander, On the Art of Horsemanship, </I>and<I> On 
Hunting</I>). Why did he adopt the dialogue form here? Much odder is the fact 
that he chose Socrates as his expert in household management. Although an 
impressive personality and an original thinker, Socrates was not exactly a 
successful householder. By all ordinary standards, he was a miserable failure in 
all aspect of household management. Not only that, he often criticized people 
who thought that successful household management was the right thing to spend 
all of one&rsquo;s time pursuing.</P>
<P align=left>In order to overcome the gross improbability of Socrates&rsquo; 
giving advice on this subject, Xenophon presents the bulk of his advice in the 
form of a recounted conversation he once had with one Ischomachos, a respectable 
Athenian gentleman who could claim with more right knowledge about this subject. 
But then why introduce Socrates in the first place? This question will occupy us 
for the bulk of this essay because it appears to me that the effort to answer it 
will bring us close to the heart of Xenophon&rsquo;s thinking about economic 
matters. </P>
<P align=left>Another peculiarity, and one which may help shed light on the 
question of Socrates&rsquo; role here: Xenophon&rsquo;s decision to write a 
manual which includes a large section on farming techniques seems bizarre when 
we notice that in his opinion there is nothing to teach about this subject that 
is not obvious and known to everyone already. This is what Ischomachos, the 
great expert in the subject, says (20.2-11), and he proves it by leading 
Socrates to discover on his own all the essentials of good farming (16.8-19.19). 
These comments seem to contradict the purpose for which the work was apparently 
written, namely to provide practical advice about these very matters. In order 
to understand this peculiar and fascinating dialogue we need to consider first 
not its homely subject matter, but rather its dramatic structure.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>I</P>
<P align=left>The <I>Oeconomicus</I> is divided into two parts. Chapters 1-6 
record a conversation between Socrates and Critoboulos. In the course of this 
conversation, Socrates convinces Critoboulos that he is fiscally irresponsible, 
and as a result, Critoboulos turns to Socrates, asking him to take charge of him 
and improve his situation (2.9). Socrates refuses to do this, but does offer to 
introduce him to others who can help him better than he can (2.15-3.16). He does 
not fulfill this promise fully, but he does recount for Critoboulos a 
conversation he had previously with one Ischomachus, in which most of the 
subjects he has promised are discussed. This recounting takes up the entire 
remainder of the book (7-21) and Critoboulos, the primary dramatic audience for 
Socrates&rsquo; words (there are others as well: see 3.1), is never mentioned 
again. The conversation with Ischomachus therefore comprises the bulk of the 
<I>Oeconomicus</I>, and it is there that Xenophon finds the occasion to offer 
what practical advice the book contains.</P>
<P align=left>Perhaps it would be helpful to provide an outline of the contents 
of the book, divided according to the present chapter divisions, bearing in 
mind, however, that Xenophon was not responsible for the division into 
chapters:</P>
<P align=left></P><B>
<P align=left>Table of Contents</B>:</P><B>
<P align=left>Part One: Conversation with Critoboulos</P></B>
<P align=left>Chapter 1: Socrates convinces Critoboulos that wealth is that 
which is useful to a person.</P>
<P align=left>Chapter 2: Socrates convinces Critoboulos that he is wealthier 
than him, and agrees to introduce him to others who can teach him the various 
household arts.</P>
<P align=left>Chapter 3: Socrates describes successful and unsuccessful 
practitioners of the various household arts.</P>
<P align=left>Chapter 4: Socrates describes how Cyrus, the wealthy king of 
Persia, devoted himself to warfare and agriculture.</P>
<P align=left>Chapter 5: Socrates speaks of the manifold benefits, including 
moral benefits, of agricultural work.</P>
<P align=left>Chapter 6: Socrates summarizes the conclusions they have agreed on 
and offers to recount a previous conversation with Ischomachus.</P>
<P align=left></P><B>
<P align=left>Part Two: Previous conversation with Ischomachos</P>
<P align=left>I Women&rsquo;s matters</B>: Ischomachos recounts his conversation 
with his wife in which he trained her to be responsible for the household:</P>

<P align=left></P><B>
<P align=left>III Farming</B>:</P>
<P align=left>15: Socrates requests instruction in the art of farming, and 
Ischomachos responds by praising the profession and pointing out that it is the 
easiest art to learn.</P>
<P align=left>16-18. Ischomachos explains how easy it is to identify good soil 
and shows that Socrates already knows how to sow and reap wheat and barley.</P>
<P align=left>19: Ischomachos shows that Socrates already knows how to cultivate 
trees.</P>
<P align=left>20: The secret of success in farming: not knowledge, only hard 
work.</P>
<P align=left></P><B>
<P align=left>IV Chapter 21</B>: The mark of a good ruler of men: the ability to 
inspire devotion and hard work.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>This outline shows how the composition moves from the most 
theoretical to the most practical, from the question of what is wealth, to the 
detailed discussion of how to work the land. The opening chapter and the first 
part of the second chapter (2.1-8) together with the pseudo-Platonic 
<I>Eryxias</I>, Xenophon&rsquo;s <I>Ways and Means</I>, some of 
Aristotle&rsquo;s comments in book five of the <I>Ethics</I> and book one of the 
<I>Politics</I>, and some scattered comments by Plato in the <I>Republic</I> and 
the <I>Laws</I>, represent what we have left of an evidently thriving debate 
among Socratics about economic science.</P>
<P align=left>Oddly enough, however, this theoretical section of the 
<I>Economicus</I> seems to be in conflict with the remainder of the work. The 
theoretical arguments undermine common assumptions about wealth which provide 
the basis for much of what is said in the remainder. After explaining to 
Critoboulos that it is better to pursue wisdom than property, Socrates appears 
to devote all of his efforts to helping him pursue property. This makes it 
difficult to understand what sort of economic advice Xenophon is offering us 
here, and how he conceives the art or science of economics.</P>
<P align=left>There are two very different ways in which the science of 
economics might be conceived. In its conventional form, economics is a tool for 
increasing the resources of the household. It teaches us when to plant, which 
crops to plant, how to select horses and other livestock, and even offers advice 
on more sensitive issues such as how to train and supervise wives, servants and 
children. Understood in this way, economic science helps people achieve wealth 
without bothering to teach them what wealth is in the first place. It leaves 
ordinary conceptions intact. This is close to the modern understanding of 
economic science, and it is what the bulk of the <I>Oeconomicus </I>seems to 
offer.</P>
<P align=left>But there is another more &lsquo;Socratic&rsquo; way in which 
economic science might be conceived. It would strive first for knowledge of the 
nature, the quiddity (<I>mahut</I>), of wealth. No one knew better than Socrates 
and his friends that it is futile to pursue wealth without knowing what it is. 
This is an issue that was discussed frequently in Socratic circles. In 
Xenophon&rsquo;s <I>Symposium</I> (4.34-44) Antisthenes points out that true 
wealth is not a matter of material resources, but is a spiritual or intellectual 
property. At a later date, the author of the pseudo-Platonic <I>Eryxias</I> 
argues that happiness, not property, is wealth (393e).</P>
<P align=left>Apart from formal arguments about the nature of wealth, the 
Socratics seem to have agreed that the possession of unreasonably large amounts 
of property is unnecessary. Aristotle makes it abundantly clear that the 
accumulation of property can never be an end in itself, and seems to imply that 
some form of wisdom or prudence must be involved in setting limits to the 
pursuit of property (<I>Politics</I> 1.3.8-9). Plato&rsquo;s communistic 
<I>Republic</I> shows how little importance he attached to the possession of 
property. In the <I>Memorabilia</I> (1.6) and in other places, Socrates defends 
his life of poverty on the grounds that it is a better life than any other. For 
this reason, it would be strange if Xenophon&rsquo;s Socrates, whom Antisthenes 
credits as the source of his own spiritual &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; 
(<I>Symposium</I> 4.43), should offer a purely conventional account of economic 
science which encourages the accumulation of property.</P>
<P align=left>In fact he does not. In the opening, theoretical, section of the 
<I>Oeconomicus</I>, Socrates argues that ordinary property is not a form of 
wealth (<I>chremata</I>) unless its owner knows how to make use of it. Knowledge 
is an essential component of wealth because it transforms otherwise useless 
objects into tools which serve a good purpose. For this reason obtaining 
knowledge is the first priority for anyone who aims at becoming wealthy. And it 
is not clear how much property one would actually need in the end: Socrates at 
any rate had very little and yet shows himself wealthier than Critoboulos (2.9). 
The opening chapters of the <I>Oeconomicus</I> thus call into question common 
assumptions about the meaning of wealth and the aim of economic science. The 
doubts that Socrates raises about the nature of wealth do not imply that 
property could not be a component of wealth. But they do make it clear that for 
someone like Critoboulos, who does not know how to make use of his wealth, 
property is not a form of wealth at all. He does not need more property, he 
needs more wisdom. This is what Socrates seems to be saying at in the first 
chapter of the work.</P>
<P align=left>This makes it all the more surprising that Socrates ends up 
agreeing that Critoboulos needs more property than he has (2.1), and spends the 
vast bulk of his time apparently offering him advice concerning how to acquire 
it (see 2.18). How can we explain this?</P>
<P align=left>In order to explain Socrates&rsquo; words here, we have to 
remember the dialogical character of the <I>Oeconomicus</I>. What Socrates says 
to Critoboulos is not the same as what he would say to Antisthenes, for example. 
Critoboulos is interested in saving his fortune; Socrates uses that interest to 
guide him subtly towards higher things. He offers to help Critoboulos, but in 
fact he has other things on his mind.</P>
<P align=left>If we look a bit closer, we will notice that Socrates does not 
really give Critoboulos precisely the advice that he has asked for. As we have 
noted, although he promises to introduce him to practitioners of the various 
household arts (2.15-3.16), he does not hurry to do so. Instead Socrates speaks 
of the agricultural and military activities of Cyrus, the king of Persia (4), 
explains the virtues of the life of farming (5), and recounts a conversation he 
once had with Ischomachos, a respectable Athenian gentleman (7-21), who finally 
offers some of the practical advice Critoboulos was seeking. Socrates&rsquo; aim 
seems to be more ethical than economic: he wants to persuade Critoboulos to 
adopt the healthy, humble lifestyle of a gentleman-farmer.</P>
<P align=left>For this reason he emphasizes the fact that Cyrus himself, the 
king of Persia, worked the land with his own hands, and goes on to offer high 
praise for farming in chapter five and in his summary in chapter six. But this 
intention is also evident in his lengthy discussion with Ischomachos. 
Ischomachos was certainly a wealthy man; but this is not his most important 
attribute in the conversation with Socrates. In fact, during the<FONT size=2> 
</FONT>course of the conversation, Socrates demonstrates an almost complete lack 
of interest in Ischomachos&rsquo; money-making skills. He is interested in 
Ischomachos because he is an example of a real gentleman (<I>kalos 
k&rsquo;agathos</I>), and he hopes to learn something about his general way of 
life. Socrates recounts this conversation not simply to teach Critoboulos a 
lesson in fiscal responsibility (a subject which did interest Xenophon elsewhere 
&ndash; see <I>Ways and Means, Cyropaedia</I>),<I> </I>but rather to direct him 
to a better way of life, a life of hard work and responsibility. As he says, 
agriculture is the most just profession: it rewards its practitioners strictly 
in accordance with their efforts (5.12). So far is Socrates from encouraging 
profiteering, that by the end of his tale, he is actually criticizing 
Ischomachos&rsquo; father on the grounds that he farms with the ulterior motive 
of making a profit from the resale of the land (20.26-28).</P>
<P align=left>These simple observations offer us a first insight into the reason 
Xenophon chose Socrates as the main speaker in the <I>Oeconomicus</I>, and into 
the nature of the <I>Oeconomicus</I> as a whole. Socrates is appropriate not 
because he has any special knowledge about household management &ndash; Xenophon 
is at pains to acknowledge Socrates&rsquo; incompetence in this field (2.11-13) 
-- but because he offers an ethical critique and a corrective to the economic 
impulse which motivates men like Critoboulos. He is engaged in an act of 
education in the original meaning of the word: he is leading Critoboulos away 
from his pecuniary interests and seeking to turn him into a real gentleman. And 
for this reason the first theoretical section is a genuine part of the whole: 
together with the rest of the work, it aims to reduce Critoboulos&rsquo; 
preoccupation with the things that money brings, and to force him, and readers 
like him, to find activities worth pursuing for their own sakes. It aims to turn 
Critoboulos into a respectable Athenian gentleman, a real Ischomachos. The 
<I>Oeconomicus</I> is an ethical dialogue disguised as an economic treatise.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>II</P>
<P align=left>But this is not the only role Socrates is playing here, and this 
is not the only message Xenophon has for his readers. After all, Socrates 
himself is no Ischomachos. Far from being a respectable farmer-gentleman of the 
sort whose lifestyle he is trying to sell to Critoboulos, Socrates was just the 
opposite. He was not merely ignorant of household management, he was a living 
catastrophe with respect to this art, at least as it was usually understood. If 
we follow Xenophon&rsquo;s division of household management into two parts, that 
concerned with the duties of the woman, and that concerned with the duties of 
the man, we can say without hesitation that Socrates was a miserable failure in 
both of its parts. He was known for his poverty, for walking barefoot, and for 
never spending a day working. And he was so unsuccessful in training his wife, 
that her name has become proverbial for the shrew (see <I>Symposium</I> 2.10, 
<I>Memorabilia</I> 2.2).</P>
<P align=left>It is important to bear in mind not only that Socrates was a 
dismal failure in these areas, but also that he was publicly ridiculed for it. 
Aristophanes portrayed Socrates on stage as a walker on air, an utterly 
impractical person who was unable to obtain his daily sustenance by reputable 
means (<I>Clouds</I> 175-9; 218-225; see also <I>Birds</I> 1280; 1553). Xenophon 
too records in his <I>Memorabilia</I> the fact that Socrates was publicly 
attacked for leading a miserable and impoverished existence (1.6). And Plato 
records similar attacks in his <I>Gorgias</I> and elsewhere. It is not merely 
that he was a failure at money-making, but he was not even considered a 
respectable gentleman.</P>
<P align=left>Rather than an appropriate symbol of the upstanding gentleman, 
Socrates, in a sense, was the anti-gentleman of Athens, and for this reason he 
could serve as the inspiration for Antisthenes and the Cynic school. The 
existence of this antagonism between him and the respectable citizens of Athens 
was something that both Socrates and his enemies would have gladly acknowledged 
(see <I>Phaedo</I> 64a-b). Socrates was critical of those who, like Critoboulos, 
took it for granted that their wealth and social standing made them something 
worthy of envy. In the <I>Republic</I>, for example, Plato portrays 
Socrates&rsquo; dispute with the wealthy Cephalos, and his advocacy of a radical 
form of communism. In the <I>Crito</I>, he rejects the widespread values that 
would demand that he take care of his family above all else 46bff. So it is hard 
to imagine that Xenophon could have conceived of Socrates as someone who saw the 
life of the respectable gentleman as the highest ideal.</P>
<P align=left>The Athenians, for their part, never seem to have taken 
Socrates&rsquo; &ldquo;criticism&rdquo; to heart. They surely laughed at this 
pathetic and foolish man not only when Aristophanes ridiculed him in his 
comedies, but also in real life. This conflict between Socrates and the Athenian 
gentlemen is a prominent, if subdued, theme in the <I>Oeconomicus</I>. Xenophon 
invites us to consider the contrast not only between Socrates and Critoboulos 
but also that between Socrates and Ischomachos. The most serious theme of the 
<I>Oeconomicus</I> is not Socrates&rsquo; effort to turn Critoboulos into 
Ischomachus, but rather the mutual antagonism between Socrates the philosopher 
and Ischomachos the symbol of the respectable citizen of Athens. Were they right 
to laugh at his poverty, and was he right to question the value of their 
successes? In places, Ischomachos&rsquo; description of the life of a wealthy 
estate-owner appears to be an open critique of the impoverished, unproductive 
and even lazy lifestyle of Socrates (<I>e.g.</I> 20.15: see below). And Socrates 
for his part is in no way reluctant to point out the failings of the gentlemanly 
way of life led by Ischomachos. Here is where we find the real drama of the 
<I>Oeconomicus</I>: in this unfolding mutual settling of accounts between 
Ischomachos, the respectable citizen, and Socrates, the philosopher. It is here 
in the <I>Oeconomicus</I> that Xenophon offers his most revealing insights into 
the nature of that antagonism.</P>
<P align=left>There would be nothing surprising about attributing this sort of 
loosely apologetic motive to the <I>Oeconomicus</I>. Xenophon devoted his 
<I>Apology</I> and his <I>Memorabilia</I> to defending Socrates from a variety 
of charges, and even his <I>Symposium</I> has some apologetic aims. These works 
were designed to show not only that Socrates was innocent of the legal charges, 
but also that far from being a miserable failure, Socrates was in fact a 
supremely happy person, more deserving of envy than of pity and contempt. And 
apologetic elements even appear in Xenophon&rsquo;s major non-Socratic works: 
<I>Cyropaedia</I>, <I>Anabasis </I>and<I> Hellenica</I>. All of this makes it 
extremely reasonable to suppose that the <I>Oeconomicus</I> too is designed, in 
part, to confront one of the charges against Socrates: the charge that he was a 
miserable failure as a householder.</P>
<P align=left>But this is more than just a reasonable supposition. There are 
unmistakable signs of an apologetic intention here. This comes out clearest in 
chapter eleven, where Xenophon&rsquo;s Ischomachos says that he spends a great 
deal of time preparing for his own self-defense (11.21-25), and the words he 
uses both recall those used by Socrates (<I>Apology</I> 2-3) and indicate the 
vast difference between the two: while both men claim to have spent their whole 
life preparing their defenses, Socrates meant this in a figurative sense -- that 
his whole life was an act of justice &ndash; and did not mean that he wasted 
even one moment actually writing a speech. Ischomachos, on the other hand, says 
quite clearly that he spends a large amount of time practicing speeches for his 
inevitable day in court. We are invited to wonder which one of the two spent his 
time in a more enviable manner. We are reminded that Socrates was not the only 
potential victim of Athenian litigation: every citizen, respected as he might 
be, was a potential victim of the sycophants and other amateur accusers who 
sprung up like locusts in fifth century Athens.</P>
<P align=left>It is earlier in this same chapter that Xenophon makes the charge 
against Socrates explicit:</P><FONT face=Narkisim size=4>
<P align=right>כיצד אוכל בצדק לתקן אדם מושלם ביופי וטוב?' שאלתי, 'שהרי אני נחשב 
לפטפטן ולמודד אוויר וגם מכונה בגינוי המגוחך ביותר &ndash; עני! (4) והייתי מדוכא 
מאוד בגלל גינוי זה, איסכומכוס, לולא פגשתי לא מכבר את סוסו החדש של ניקֵיאס 
[הנוכרי], וראיתי את הצופים הרבים שהלכו אחריו ושמעתי כמה מהם מדברים עליו רבות. 
ואז ניגשתי לסייס ושאלתי אותו אם יש לסוס הרבה כסף. (5) הוא הביט בי כאילו יצאתי 
מדעתי ואמר: &lsquo;כיצד יכול להיות לסוס כסף?&rsquo; התעודדתי כששמעתי שמותר לסוס 
עני להיות טוב, אם נפשו טובה מטבעה.</P></FONT>
<P align=left>[How could I justly correct a man who is a perfect gentleman? I 
asked. For I am considered a chatterer and a measurer of the air, and am even 
called -- the most ridiculous insult of all -- a pauper! I would be very 
depressed about this insult, Ischomachos, if I had not recently bumped into the 
new horse of Nicias the foreigner. I saw many spectators walking after him, and 
I heard some of them speaking about him. So I went up to the horseman and asked 
him if the horse had much money. He looked at me as though I were insane, and 
said, &ldquo;How could the horse have money? I was encouraged when I heard that 
it is permissible for a horse to be good if its spirit is by nature a good one. 
11.3-5]</P>
<P align=left>Here we see the first line of defense: Socrates claims that 
neither money nor a lack of money make one a good or a bad person. As he says in 
the opening chapter of the work, what is important is the knowledge one has 
about how to make good use of one&rsquo;s possessions.</P>
<P align=left>But this is not the only defense Xenophon has to offer, and it is 
not the main thrust of the <I>Oeconomicus</I>. A second line of defense opens up 
when we consider a comment that Socrates makes in the <I>Symposium</I>. There he 
claims that of all his accomplishments, he is most proud of his ability as a 
pimp (3.10). He says that although he has never actually made use of this skill, 
he could have made a lot of money if he had. Later he explains that pimping 
means teaching others how to present themselves before their fellow citizens, 
and especially before the city (4.60). This joke is not only mildly funny, it is 
also designed to address charges of incompetence raised against Socrates.</P>
<P align=left>Socrates&rsquo; words imply that he could have presented himself 
successfully to the city had he wanted to, but he simply did not want to. That 
is what Xenophon shows in the <I>Apology</I> as well. There he claims that 
Socrates&rsquo; failure in court was not a failure at all, but the successful 
result of a deliberate strategy designed to achieve the goal it did achieve: an 
easy death before the onset of senility. The point is clear and it is the same 
point that is being made implicitly in the <I>Symposium</I>: if Socrates had 
wanted to, he could have won, he simply did not want to.</P>
<P align=left>The <I>Oeconomicus</I> offers a similar line of defense. After 
pointing out in the first chapter that property is not in itself a useful or 
good thing, Xenophon goes on in the second chapter to argue that even on more 
conventional grounds, Socrates was a more successful householder than some of 
the richest men in Athens. This is because the true measure of wealth is not the 
amount of property one possesses, but the degree of one&rsquo;s financial 
solvency: the ratio between income and expenses. Since Socrates had such low 
expenses, he was actually wealthier, in an almost conventional sense, than rich 
men such as Critoboulos, who were burdened with public responsibilities. 
Critoboulos is good enough to acknowledge that Socrates, poor as he is, is a 
better financial planner than he himself is. He is convinced that if Socrates 
were in his position, he would do a much better job of balancing the books than 
he himself has done, and he invites Socrates to take charge of his 
household.</P>
<P align=left>Through this dramatic turn of events, Xenophon has offered a new, 
surprising, line of defense for Socrates. Socrates had genuine financial skills, 
he knew how to reduce expenses (see <I>Apology</I> 25) and was in this sense 
superior, financially, to some of the wealthiest citizens. Socrates never 
amassed a large sum of money, just as he was not a successful &lsquo;pimp&rsquo; 
in practice; but he did know better than most how to handle money.</P>
<P align=left>Xenophon goes still further in this odd line of argument. Socrates 
was not only an expert in balancing the books, not only a good potential 
manager, but he was also deeply knowledgeable about the details of running a 
household. This claim is somewhat less plausible than the previous one, since 
Socrates never demonstrated anything resembling ability in this area. In order 
to make it plausible, Xenophon has to provide a convincing and reputable outside 
source for Socrates&rsquo; knowledge, and this he does: Socrates learned all 
about household management from a conversation he had with the wealthy 
gentleman, Ischomachos. Although he did not discover the art on his own, nor 
practice it himself, his widely ridiculed chattering paid rich dividends when it 
brought him into close conversation with this gentleman. As a result of that 
conversation, Socrates does indeed know all one needs to know about this 
subject. Had he wanted to, he could have put this knowledge into practice for 
himself: after all, he is still able, on the basis of this ancient conversation, 
to offer good practical advise, useful to men with more experience than himself, 
such as Critoboulos.</P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>III</P>
<P align=left>But this entire line of reasoning only opens up a more troubling 
and genuinely philosophical question: if he really had these abilities, why 
didn&rsquo;t he use them? Why didn&rsquo;t Socrates adopt the advice he was so 
well-equipped to dispense? Why did he choose the life of poverty when he could 
have been a successful householder or pimp? This question is serious because it 
forces us to confront the possibility that Socrates chose his life of poverty 
deliberately, and hence it places before us the unpleasant suggestion that a 
life of Socratic poverty might be somehow better for a human being, better for 
us, than any alternative. And who would want to believe that? This question 
provides the real dramatic interest in the conversation between Ischomachos and 
Socrates. Who really lead the better life, Socrates or Ischomachos? But to see 
why this is so, we need to consider again the peculiar dramatic structure of the 
<I>Oeconomicus</I>.</P>
<P align=left>The fact that Socrates re-tells his former encounter with 
Ischomachos to Critoboulos invites us to consider that encounter from two 
entirely different points of view. As we have observed, the conversation is 
presented to Critoboulos for its helpful teachings on household management and 
gentlemanly behavior. It is designed to provide him with a model, Ischomachos, 
whom he might really strive to imitate. But that was not the purpose that 
Socrates had in mind when he first approached Ischomachos. Socrates&rsquo; 
purpose in speaking with Ischomachos was not to learn the household arts, or 
even to learn to become a gentleman, but to find out whether Ischomachos really 
was a gentleman or not, and to decide whether or not his was a life worth 
imitating.</P>
<P align=left>Certainly Socrates did not seek out Ischomachos as an 
unimpeachable authority on household management or gentlemanship. He interviewed 
him after having been disappointed with all the previous candidates he had 
interviewed (6.12-17). These interviews were designed to evaluate the 
candidates, not uncritically to approve of them. And it is clear enough that as 
he rejected the others, so too Socrates never did take Ischomachos as his model. 
His conversation with Critoboulos took place years later than the conversation 
with Ischomachos, and yet Socrates still has not acquired any personal 
experience in running a household, and still has to refer back to Ischomachos as 
the source of all his knowledge in this area. Clearly, he considered Ischomachos 
as a model and rejected him. Why?</P>
<P align=left>Socrates&rsquo; ultimate critique of Ischomachos is indicated 
already in the emphasis he puts on his efforts to grasp how Ischomachos has 
earned the <I>reputation</I> for being a gentleman (6.12-17; 7.2-3). The earning 
of a reputation is not the same thing as the pursuit of excellence 
(<I>arete</I>). The two may even be in conflict: the price of devotion to 
one&rsquo;s reputation may be the abandonment of the pursuit of virtue itself, 
particularly if reputation is based in part on the acquisition of things which, 
like wealth, are not worth bothering about. Socrates was surely, in 
Xenophon&rsquo;s eyes at least, a man of virtue, but he had not exerted himself 
to acquire a reputation for it.</P>
<P align=left>Socrates&rsquo; first question to Ischomachos already expresses 
his fundamental criticism of Ischomachos&rsquo; whole way of life: </P><FONT 
face=Narkisim>
<P align=right>מדוע אתה יושב כך, איסכומכוס? שהרי אינך רגיל לשבת בטל. בדרך כלל 
אני רואה אותך עוסק בדבר מה או לפחות לא מתבטל לגמרי בשוק 7.1</P></FONT>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>Why do you sit in this way Ischomachos? You do not generally sit 
around at leisure. In general I see you busy at something, or at least not 
completely unoccupied in the market-place.</P>
<P align=left>The question is superficially insulting, and it challenges 
Ischomachos to account for his present irresponsible activity. It contains also 
an implied compliment: Ischomachos&rsquo; present laziness is totally 
uncharacteristic of him. Usually he is better employed than this. And yet, when 
we reflect that being at leisure in the market place was precisely what Socrates 
did do all day, we may suspect that there is a note of challenge precisely in 
that friendly implication. Is it really better to be, like Ischomachos, a slave 
to all kinds of serious responsibilities, as Socrates implies? Or is it not a 
shame that Ischomachos was so rarely at leisure, like Socrates, in the 
market-place?</P>
<P align=left>The conversation recorded here obviously could never have taken 
place if Ischomachos had gone about his daily routine on this day as he did on 
most other days. Even on this occasion his apparent leisure is only the 
unfortunate result of the fact that he has been stood up by some guests whom he 
had agreed to meet here (7.2). He would prefer to be busy. He persists in 
wasting his time waiting for them in order to preserve his good name as a man 
who fulfills his promises (12.1-2). This is an example of the suffering he must 
undergo for the sake of his reputation, and it also shows that he would never be 
at leisure if it were not an obligation. There is something admirable about 
Ischomachos&rsquo; devotion to duty; but he clearly lacks the leisure time with 
which Socrates&rsquo; life abounds, and this is a rather serious matter. At any 
rate, Xenophon&rsquo;s Antisthenes says in the <I>Symposium</I> that his most 
valuable possession is the leisure he has to spend with Socrates 
(<I>Symposium</I> 4.44). And Charmides notes that the wealthy cannot spend time 
with Socrates without being subject to criticism (<I>Symposium</I> 4.32). 
Xenophon himself says quite clearly that nothing is better than spending time 
with this great man (<I>Apology</I> 34). On this particular day, Ischomachus has 
had the great good luck of running into Socrates. But the event was only a rare, 
and from his point of view unfortunate, accident, and there are no signs that he 
makes any good use of the opportunity. Rather than learning anything from 
Socrates, he gives him a long lecture on household management. And there is no 
indication that his meeting with Socrates has inspired in him any interest in 
pursuing excellence at a later time either (compare <I>Memorabilia</I> 
1.4.1).</P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
