Hi Myrna<BR>
<BR>
I appreciate your picking up Nachum at the airport:&nbsp; I would at present find it exhausting.&nbsp; If you have time, please come up for a tea, or stronger, when you drop him off: you can park for a limited time in the driveway. Of course you will get to see him over the next few weeks.<BR>
<BR>
My schedule for the week is settled:&nbsp; I will be visited Wednesday chez moi by a Visiting Nurse around 10:00 AM, and by a Social Worker at 1:30 PM.&nbsp; I will go to the Hospital for testing on Thursday, not Wednesday.&nbsp; This had been, like Nachum, 'up in the air.'<BR>
<BR>
Thanks again for the pickup.<BR>
<BR>
Phil<BR>
