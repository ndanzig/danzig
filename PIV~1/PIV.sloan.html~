<BR>
He was curious about my being treated by Dr. Bruckner at Lutheran with five medicines simultaneously, but NOT in a way to alarm me. We discussed the advantages and disadvantages of that over the usual two medicines.<BR>
<BR>
He pointed out that there was one test which had NOT been administered to me: involving radioactive sugar.&nbsp; But he noted that it was 'conclusive' in only 25% of the cases in uncovering the organ of origin.&nbsp; Dr. Bruckner had told me that delaying treatment on such a slim indicator was not worth it, in his opinion.&nbsp; I agreed to take this test at S-K, with the results to be forwarded also, to Dr. Bruckner.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Chung also gave me an overall physical, which included measuring my height. The last time that was done was 15 - 20 years ago and since then I have apparently shrunk 1&nbsp; 1/2&nbsp; inches.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, I FEEL more 'grounded' than previously. <BR>
<BR>
I asked Dr. Chung how long he had been with S-K and he said he was finishing a four-year fellowship.&nbsp; I asked where he'd been before:&nbsp; Johns Hopkins.&nbsp; I was further impressed.<BR>
<BR>
He asked should I take home my X-rays or should he copy them?&nbsp; I asked him to copy them, then return them as I want to keep this avenue open, <BR>
<BR>
Today, I returned to Lutheran [it takes about as long to get there, in Sunset Park, as it takes to get to Mountainside Hospital, in Montclair!]&nbsp; and found, as expected, that my white and red blood counts were depressed.&nbsp; They gave me two shots to stimulate production [W &amp; R] and I return again, Thursday and Friday.<BR>
<BR>
I am hiccupping but Dr. Edna at Lutheran, who saw me today, does NOT think that that is connected with my main condition.&nbsp; I was give a medication for THAT, also.<BR>
<BR>
This situation will NOT clear up with any rapidity, is a long term condition for which the 'cure' or amelioration will only be found by trial and error.&nbsp; It is questionable whether I will find real relief before, or, after, the US Army leaves Iraq.<BR>
<BR>
I appreciate your concern, of course !<BR>
<BR>
Much love,&nbsp;&nbsp; Me</FONT></HTML>
