<HTML><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><FONT  BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10>Dear Naomi<BR>
<BR>
Thanks so much for your recent e-mail, which you (unfortunately) had to recrreate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
 &nbsp;Yes, the 'miracle' of modern technology can sometimes backfire! &nbsp;&nbsp;But be assured that it meant much to me to receive it. &nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
I am reading about South Aftica again, as it used to be in the news a lot under Aparteid, but has largely been put onto the 'back burner' now. &nbsp;I read that the importatio of European trees has done uchnto reduce the natural runoff of water from the mountains,and that there is a large program, to cut this foreign flora down. &nbsp;I wonder that if you merely cut thetree down, the roots will sprout again, and the prcess must be repeated.<BR>
<BR>
What a shame that we have introduced so many changes, largely negative, into our environments. &nbsp;The rabbit in Australia is the oldsest example, butmnew ones abound (no pun intended !). &nbsp;&nbsp;Did rabbits evolve into kangaroos there ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: - ) &nbsp;It seems that various oceanic fishing grounds are bveing systematically 'fished out' also. &nbsp;Imagine, fishing our a special fromthe ocean ! I read that there were thousands, if not millions of hugh sea turtles in the Carraibean 200 years ago, now mostly gone.,<BR>
<BR>
Woldn't it be gand to visit the Galapolaos Isalnds to see one of the last 'natural' areas, only beginning to be be forever altered by the hand of man ?<BR>
<BR>
I saw an account of the Zulo Wars on TV with an explanatio of how they devastated a British garisson 50 yers ago. &nbsp;Factineating. &nbsp;Apparently the Zulus (about 20,000of them) gathered for ways and went through preparatory rituals, involving music, dance and varrious drug made from plants. &nbsp;These produced alterd states and protection fro pain, all of which united them into an effective fighting force.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the British, the program surmises, plced their advane line very far from the base camp, making for a less concentrated defense, and permitting the Zulus to break through. &nbsp;Of course, the British then took the problem more seriously and, like the Unted Staes around th sametime, sent in large numbers of troops to settle the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is prtetty horrid, of course, and shows thatt he human environment was being compromised along with the &nbsp;atural environment.<BR>
<BR>
I feel sad and empathetic to the plight of the native Americnas, even though my ancestors were in Poland and Russia at that time, but I know that much of the comfort of my life is enjoyed at the past suffereing of many people. &nbsp;The quandry is, what may be done about it, now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
While the United States is realtively calm, other areas are not. &nbsp;I am concerned about conditions in S. Africa, and read about car theft, and automobile flame throwers and worry aboutmyour safety, but I won;t dwell on it. &nbsp;I think that getting to know more about S. Africa, the positive and otherwise, &nbsp;is, in a way, to get to klk ow yu better, and that I enjoy.<BR>
<BR>
You asked about my children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest was named Gabriel Alexamder [40] , and was called Gaby as a child [Gaby the Baby many, mnay years ago !] &nbsp;Now he spells it Gavriel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My middle son was named Henry James [37], a name most unsuitable to his temperment. &nbsp;&nbsp;He is working hard at working hard amd is, happily, succeeding. &nbsp;&nbsp;I used to worry about him, but his life is on the &nbsp;ost positive track now, thank G-d.<BR>
<BR>
My youngest is Nickolas Rex ! &nbsp;[32] but he change this to nachum around the time he went to College at Brandies University. &nbsp;He wanted to have a Jewish experience there and this reinforced his commitment to Judaism. &nbsp;He lives in Jerusalem, where he was ordained aas &nbsp;a Rabbi a t the smae time that he received a degree in computers [from the same institution]. &nbsp;&nbsp;He now maintains their computer netewordk and also teaches Torah and other religious subjects. &nbsp;He is studying for an advanced degree at Hebrew University, whichinvolvedleraning ARabic.<BR>
<BR>
I discussed, or, more accurately, negotiated the names of these children with their moter at the time of birth. &nbsp;In general she selevted the first name, with some consultation with me, and I appended the middle name. &nbsp;It was not entirely satisfactory but accurately relfected her possessive attitude to them, at the time. &nbsp;I always wanted a softer, cooperative and sahred give and take, in this and in all decisions, but this depends on a similarity of approch by the other party, doesn;t it ?<BR>
<BR>
I felt for a long time, that with patience her attitude would ameleriote as she learned to trust me, but I was, unfortuantely, mistaken in this. &nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, I became more assertive and this change was soething which srurprised and, perhaps, freightened her. &nbsp;She must have seen my change &nbsp;[which was cccompanied by couples therapy. marriiage counselling and so forth] as akin to the Bantu uprising, and, unfortuately unable to change, resisted. &nbsp;&nbsp;We were living in England, actually, when PM Macmillian announced, that "There is a wind of change sweeping across Africa...." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she never felt the breeze. &nbsp;&nbsp;Rahter than face a massacre, we separated .. &nbsp;..<BR>
<BR>
I HAVE received some worrisome news from Gavrrial, just two days ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the time he moved there, I told hi I was concerned about the danger, but it was his decision, and so I have never raised to subject: &nbsp;his is a grown man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably his optimism and pride prevented hi &nbsp;frosnbari g his legitimate worry all along and fears with me., &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along, he has never complained about iving in to Settlement area, and said he woujld move if Isreal gave signs of not protecting those areas. <BR>
<BR>
So I was rther startled that he now wants to move, but only bacause of the suddeness of his telling me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the value of his house has seriously deprecated, and his stocks on the market are severaly down [they were in echnologies] . &nbsp;Therefore, he is ain a predicab=ment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insteadof moving, he wants to purchzse a 'bullet-proof' car.<BR>
<BR>
He asked me for financial assistance, which I can and would oprovide, but the he asked another 'favor.' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hates, is allergic, to asking 'favors.' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would I make Alyea to Isrel, and purchase the car in my name, and thereby sce about $6,000 in taxes !<BR>
<BR>
And he wanted me to respond over the pone. &nbsp;What I did &nbsp;ot k ow, was that he had send me, the sday before, an epmail outlinging this,but I had NOT read my mail. &nbsp;{I think you understand !] &nbsp;&nbsp;I do not like making important decisions quickly, and think that asking for citizenship to save tax money is &nbsp;++ &nbsp;++ &nbsp;not sometning I feel comforable with,, nyway.n his mind, however, it was to protect his life ! &nbsp;&nbsp;The converstiom did not progress in a calm and thoughful way.<BR>
<BR>
I 'slept on it' and what I wojld prefer is having hi solve the real problem, which is to move into Isarel proper. &nbsp;&nbsp;Better schoos, safer and more permanent. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ihave though. myslef, of making alyea some time in the future, if only to make longer visits possible. &nbsp;For e to do tnis ow and purchase a hose for myself in which he cojld liv is a more sensible idea, I think. &nbsp;I wil; wasit till afer Shabot and discuss this possibility with him.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The irony is, last &nbsp;onth, I though thatnhis life wasprocceding in sjcha deliberate way, and I was only concerned about Nachum, 'my baby !'<BR>
<BR>
My purpose in sharing this with you is not tomhave you worry, but, rahter, tobe real, and bcaue you can undersatnd theese conens which are, perhaps, not all tnat different from &nbsp;those your countrymen face, and beccause youhv shared your concerns with me, and also beasue I feel, I think you know, close to you.<BR>
<BR>
I was momentarily astounded to read in your e-mail that you had snow last week, but of course you live on the other side. &nbsp;[And walk about on you hands, no doubt !] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are getting less and less snoe in New Yrok, perhaps due tpo 'global warming.' and I do miss these strong changes of season. We use to hve almost two feet of snow, and shovelling it away i the morinings was a ral challenge. &nbsp;But a welcome one. &nbsp;&nbsp;An, living in the city thre is much less snow anyway.<BR>
<BR>
The stillness upon awakening after a night of snow is a very special emeory, pieceveed by the far aways sound of one once man and his shovel, clering his driveway in the morning. &nbsp;[The sound of one man scraping !]<BR>

'heavy' is relative ! Sunday was still cold, but the<BR>
sun shone and, sitting outside, talking to Lauren, we<BR>
both stripped down to T-shirts.<BR>
I'm so glad she is back home; I hadn't seen her since<BR>
mid-May. Her attendance at a human rights conference<BR>
(course/seminar/university credit earned) seems to<BR>
have been interesting, with friendships forged. There<BR>
were 5 selected from her university (Witwatersrand),<BR>
and I met them at the airport on Saturday. While<BR>
shaking hands with one of the boys, I was frantically<BR>
thinking "I know this person". &nbsp;Transpires his mother<BR>
is the older sister (by 2 years) of my best school<BR>
friend (at about age 14). James was delighted to hear<BR>
that he looks like his mother, who was a real beauty<BR>
at school. So, one wonders whether the influence of<BR>
mothers who attended the same boarding school has<BR>
anything to do with the resultant off-spring, that<BR>
they should both have been selected ! (Sadly, my<BR>
friend, who was an exercise freak and went on to<BR>
become a physical education teacher, died of cancer at<BR>
age 30. I remember how shocked we all were at that<BR>
time. James doesn't remember his aunt since he was<BR>
only about 3 when she died.)<BR>
Do you go to Florida when your sons are there, or do<BR>

Killing of South Africa
farmers intensifies
Elderly white couple latest victims in crime spree against Afrikaners

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The killing of white Afrikaner farmers in South Africa is intensifying, as members of the ethnic minority attempt to draw international attention to their plight. 

According to a journalist covering the killings in South Africa, since the Marxist ANC took power in 1994, 1,118 farmers have been murdered in the nation. 

"Where is President Bush on this issue? Where is Colin Powell? I know this is blacks killing whites, so that is politically correct. The media don't seem to care. And apologists like Andrew Young are saying, 'Killing whites is OK; it's part of reversing colonialism,'" said Henda Wolfardt, a South African farmer who lives near Ventersdorp with her husband and two sons. 

Wolfardt explained to WorldNetDaily, "We farmers are under siege. The communists want to drive us off the land. There is going to be a war in South Africa. In fact, it has already begun. The ANC has woken up the tiger in the Afrikaner. We see that the New World Order is a lie, and there is no place for white Christians or Orthodox Jews in it. 

"A war has been launched against us. We have no choice but to fight for our very survival. The emerging non-white majority in what used to be the Western world is very race-conscious and filled in many places with anti-white rage. Farmers feed everyone, regardless of their culture or race. So why kill all the farmers, unless you want to start a genocide?" Wolfardt asked. 

The Afrikaner are descendants of Dutch and other Europeans who settled South Africa in the 19th century. 

Adrianna Stuijt, a Dutch journalist who was once a dedicated anti-apartheid activist, has been covering the farm killings in South Africa extensively. 

Stuijt told WorldNetDaily, "Those tragically murdered farmers in Zimbabwe got huge international headlines, but thus far, the 1,118 murdered farmers in South Africa are being ignored – why would that be? I never like to use the purely racist terms 'white' or 'black' I instead prefer the ethnic minority references such as 'Afrikaner' or 'English-speaking South African,' or 'South African of Chinese origin,' 'Xhosa-speaking men,' etc. South Africa has more than 15 ethnic minority groups, and to refer to these people in such purely racist terms has become such an overwhelming habit of the ruling ANC that we do not to emulate this." 

One of the worst farm attacks in recent days came July 27, when Johan le Grange and his wife – an impoverished Afrikaner couple in their 80s who lived with their daughter and two small grandchildren on a Witbank subsistence farmlet – were ambushed by eight armed Xhosa-speaking men at 8 p.m. 

The frail Mr. le Grange was tortured before he was beaten to death. Mrs. le Grange was sadistically burnt with a hot iron but managed to survive the attack – although she remains in a severely traumatized condition, Witbank police have confirmed. 

Mr. le Grange thus became the country's 1,118th murder victim in more than 6,000 farm attacks since apartheid ended in 1994. 

After the murder of le Grange, the eight Xhosas (the majority tribe of the ruling ANC) then went to the le Granges' daughter's house nearby – on the same small holding – tied up the younger woman and her 4-year-old daughter and assaulted them repeatedly. 

After a long period of torturing their two female victims, the attackers fled with their only means of transport – an old farm truck – as well as two small handguns and a few items of cheap costume jewelry. Police found the le Grange farm vehicle abandoned at a nearby squatter camp shortly afterwards. Investigators believe the daughter's quick thinking probably saved her tiny baby's life: She had managed to hide away the infant shortly before seeing the eight heavily armed attackers entering her house. 

Stuijt told WorldNetDaily, "The details of this attack on a small holding near Witbank were so sadistic that one policeman could not contain his emotions while describing the scene on the telephone to our reporters. It is so very hard for reasonable people to explain why a large group of young, strong, heavily armed men would want to [do this]. What was the purpose? Personal gain must be ruled out here. Why all that sadistic torture? Why attack poor people? … 

"The police said the torture of the 80-year-old, frail couple, their daughter and grandchildren – and especially of the women – had been incredibly sadistic, with hot irons, nails torn out, hours of burnings and beatings. Astonishingly, the attackers did not find the infant, which the mother had hidden away just before the eight men had rushed into her home. God had another plan for that babe, clearly. We posted an appeal from the police for information on the front page of www.censorbugbear.com. To date, it has not yet appeared in the mainstream South African news media except on Radio Pretoria broadcasts." 

Meanwhile, one of South Africa's opposition minority parties, the Freedom Front – which mainly represents the Afrikaner ethnic minority community – last week urged the United Nations Human Rights Commission to probe the plight of the country's increasingly besieged Afrikaners. Dr. Pieter Mulder, the leader of the Freedom Front, presented the petition to the U.N. commission's Pretoria representative, Biong Deng. 

Mulder called the precarious situation of the 4 million-strong Afrikaner ethnic minority "a politically-motivated ethnic massacre." The party's petition stated, "The international community should reconsider its involvement with the Afrikaners in South Africa with a sense of urgency." 

Mulder said the Freedom Front also was concerned deeply about "a growing anti-Afrikaner sentiment. Afrikaner-bashing is in. A definite anti-Afrikaner sentiment was allowed to be rooted in this country." 

He said many of the criminals who appeared in courts, accused of murdering Afrikaners, were hailed by organized ANC demonstrators as heroes. At many similar court appearances anti-Afrikaner hate speech is deliberately encouraged with printed poster slogans such as: "All Boers are dogs." Many such slogans are heard chanted by ANC supporters at many appearances of defendants. "Boer" is the Dutch word for farmer. 

"Most Afrikaners are of the opinion that some of the most negative, racist interspersed arguments and utterances are, at times, publicly made by spokespeople for the government," Mulder said. 

He said there was "some orchestration" behind the more than 6,000 attacks on Afrikaner farmers since 1994. 

"In 25 percent of these attacks, nothing at all is taken. And in the vast majority of cases, people would break into a house at 10 a.m. and then wait until 3 p.m. for the people to return. Surely this makes the alarm bells ring." 

Mulder said the Mbeki government did not appear to be bothered about the anti-Afrikaner atmosphere – in spite of many official petitions and appeals from the Afrikaner community over the last six years. Last December, another appeal for increased security on farms was handed to Mbeki. It contained 350,000 signatures from members of the agricultural community – farmers and workers alike. 

"We will continue addressing this matter through the local constitutional channels, of course, but it is now also time for the matter to also be urgently internationalized," Mulder said. 

He hoped the commission would put the matter on the agenda for a future sitting, "and that this might lead to the world starting to ask questions." 

Deng said the memorandum would be forwarded to U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson in Geneva. Meanwhile, the South African Human Rights Commission also announced that they would "examine the safety problems of the country's farmers." 

Commissioner Charlotte McClain – who already heads an inquiry into human rights violations on farms – told a media briefing in Cape Town last week that there had been "a number of initiatives to address this issue. About two years ago, there was a summit that former President Nelson Mandela had put in place to address the underlying issues related to the ongoing farm killings." 

Asked whether farmers who had been the victims of attacks could also make submissions to the South African Human Rights Commission, she said, "That's correct. We've also had queries ... related to the killings on farms." 

McClain was asked if the government could be held responsible for this lack of security on farms. 

"Well, we're not a court of law, ..." she said, "but if it relates to issues of safety, we would bring in the necessary persons and ask what is happening in terms of plans for farmers." 

Wolfardt told WorldNetDaily that she has no intention of leaving her farm. 

"The blacks are killing whites in Zimbabwe, Kenya, South Africa and even in the U.S. in the recent riots in Seattle and Cincinnati. In Australia, the Aborigines are calling for the blood of the white farmers. The Russians are fighting against Islam in Chechnya. White Christians are attacked in the Balkans and Macedonia. What will it take for people to wake up?"

DEAR JAYSON  ! !

I JUST RECEIVED A LONGISH E-MAIL FROM NAOMI SO I IMMEDIATELY PHONED HER AND CAUGHT HER AT HER OFFICE, IN JOHANNESBURG.  IT BEING 4 PM THERE, SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE [AS USUAL WE HAVE THESE STRANGE PHONE CONTACTS] AND SEEMED PLEASED TO SPEAK TO ME.  THIS BEING FRIDAY, I WOULD OTHER WISE NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH HER UNTIL SUNDAY, AND THAT I COULD NOT STAND ! !

WE DISCUSSED THE SERIOUS SUBJECTS [AFRICAN INDEPENDENCE] SOME PERSONAL ONES [BIRDS] AND EVEN INTIMATE  ++  [THAT I WAS <<VERY>> HAPPY TO HEAR FROM HER, THAT I UNDERSTOOD HER TIME PRESSURES, AND THAT I WANTED TO REMAIN IN TOUCH TO SEE HOW THINGS WOULD DEVELOP,  AND THAT MY PURPOSE WAS OF THE MOST SERIOUS, WHILE RECOGNIZING THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCES INVOLVED.

SHE WAS MAINLY SILENT, BUT TOLD ME THAT SHE 'HEARD ME.'  THAT IS SUFFICIENT FOR NOW, FOR ME.

WE THEN RETURNED TO A LIGHTER VEIN, AND I [REGRETFULLY] SAID "GOOD-BY."

I AM SO HAPPY I COULD  S C R E A M ! !

I need a new telephone, and I will purchase a Seimens.. .. ..
