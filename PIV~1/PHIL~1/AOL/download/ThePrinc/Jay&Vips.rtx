On the super level, you are challenging her ability to 'set the rules of engangement' and asserting your natural rights to determine how YOU want to live. &nbsp;&nbsp;The logical position &nbsp;1) &nbsp;if there is nor rel, we should divorce, willl &nbsp;eventually sink in,. &nbsp;According to her, she cna have it both ways: &nbsp;No rel, but no divorce. &nbsp;&nbsp;Accordig to Mr,.
