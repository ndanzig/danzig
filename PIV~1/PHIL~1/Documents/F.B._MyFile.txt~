RE:	MY SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY/HARASSMENT FOLDER
	FILE NO.  52169-C

I am enclosing copies of information sent me by the New York Office of Social Security.  I  opened a retirement case there in September, as I reached the venerable age of 62 in August, and have now activated my retirement.   When, in September, I saw a question asking if I had previously opened a disability claim, I called the F&B office and spoke with Mr. Joel Solo, who did not object to me opening the claim.  Therefore, I am now sending recent correspondence:  should I fill it out?  return it?  [Note: I am approved for payment.]

This letter also confirms an appointment I made with Sam Bass on Tuesday, November 11, 1997, at 2:00 PM.   This meeting is to discuss my file #52169-C and also the case of Jose Gomez vs. Boro of Garwood, and his fall into a brook.

I  also want to take this opportunity to repeat a list of materials, documents, photos and information which I have saved relating to my case of harassment against the Newark Board of Education (AKA Newark Public Schools), as follows:

	A)	After Mr. Kokkalis made anti-Semitic remarks to me and poured coffee on my hand, I met with Daniel Gutmore, the then Chief of Staff of the Board.   He asked me about the incident and said that ôthe Board of Education wonÆt accept that kind of behavior.ö  He ordered me relocated to the tenth floor (the executive level) into an empty office (part of the Public Relations suite).   After maybe three weeks, Mr. Reynolds (KokkalisÆ superior) ordered me to relocate BACK to the eighth floor, near Design and Construction.   I  objected, but Mr. Reynolds leaned on me, and said it was NOT in D&CÆs space, but down the hall.   For this reason, and because my title was Senior Architect, and NOT public relations, I relocated.  It was at this point that Mr. Kokkalis assigned me to the ôFive-year Planö project, which ultimately led to further harassment, and my taking aömentalö  leave,  at the direction of Dr. Latimore.

	B)	I also complained, with other BD of Ed employees, to the BoardÆs medical unit (across the park on Park Place) around 1989.  Our complaint was our difficulty of breathing during the period we were relocated to the basement.  The building had been purchased by Hartz Mountain and was being renovated.  The basement space had no windows.   We worked during the day, but at night a construction crew came in to do asbestos removal.   (Yes, asbestos.)   Although they told us that the building was under positive pressure to expel particles, most of us were worried.   In fact, thereÆs a building ordinance prohibiting asbestos removal from occupied buildings, but the Newark Building Department over-ruled that.  Nothing came of this complaint. 

	C)	After developing a persistent cough (about 2-3 per minute)  around 1991-92, I was seen by an accu-puncturist in New York City.   His treatment was helpful, but symptoms persisted.   I  then was seen by Dr. Rita Charon, of Columbia - Presbyterian Hospital, New York City.   She did a full work-up, diagnosed me with ôsarcoidosisö and prescribed prendizone.    After many months, the symptoms cleared up.   I  believe the condition was caused by working in an asbestos-infested building.

	D)	During the period of my employment by the Board (June 1986 - July 1996)  I  developed a heart irregularity, or skip, or murmur, which was never previously present.   I  believe that this condition, which worries me (my father suffered from angina and died of a heart attack) was caused by stress induced while working.

	E)	In August,  I  located some paperwork and bills from my attack of ileitis which occurred in 1988, after joining the Board.  Although  I  suffered this years previously, it is now in remission.   I  believe that the new on-set was caused by stress from work at the Board.    Do you want this paperwork?
	F)	I  also located a list of my past 10 yearÆs record of proceedures at Mountainside Hospital, in Montclair.   Do you want a copy of this?

	G)	I  have moved numerous accounts and complaints I wrote of Mr. KokkalisÆ harassment of me to New York.   Some  I  had turned in to my Union and they took them up, without any effect.   Others, they received but did not bother to take action on.  Others I simply wrote to relieve the anxiety I felt at being harassed at work with nobody who could help me.  Do you want these?

	H)	I  have notes of several staff meetings during which Mr. Kokkalis singled me out for ôpersonal attentionö or abuse.   Some meetings had up to 30 people in them.  I  have records of some of these.   Do you want them?

	I)	Mr. KokkalisÆs estranged wife, Barbara, has told me of Mr. KokkalisÆs fixation on me and the antagonism he expressed towards me at home.   They are in an unpleasant divorce.   Barbara and I have traded information.  Shall  I  ask her if she would be willing to make a statement for me?

	J)	Mr. Kokkalis refused to sign for me to attend various training workshops, which were mandated under the Union contract with the Board.  Other staff could go.  One was on ôHow to Deal with Difficult Supervisors.ö   Do you want more details?

	K)	Mr. Kokkalis required me to carry a company-issued pager ôat all timesö including weekends and after hours.   I questioned him on this, since, for the most part, I was not involved in field work.   He told me to ôattach it to an appendage or stuff it into an orifice.ö   He occasionally paged me at awkward times, sometimes 3 - 4 times in one hour (as when I worked briefly on the 10th Floor).   Do you want this memo?
	L)	A few social relationships of mine have been compromised, or soured, because these friends of mine complained that I was ôobsessed with Kokkalis.ö    Some of these people may be willing to make a statement to that effect.  After leaving Board of EdÆs employment, I met Marilyn Miller (November, 1996).   We are living together.  I do think that this happy situation would NOT have been possible if  I  were still being harassed at my job with the Board.
	

Sincerely,



Phillip  I.  Danzig   RA
