I thought I had sent this out, but could not find it just now, so this may be a repeat.<BR>
Please excuse this general e-mailing.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to my first chemical therapy at the Lutheran Med. Center today, in Brooklyn Wednesday, February 11, and will receive some treatment per Doctor Bruckner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [718 - 630 - 8000]&nbsp; I will stay overnight through Thursday so they can monitor the efficacy of the treatment.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
On Monday, however, I will keep an appointment with Memorial Sloan-K to further determine the original source of trouble:&nbsp; two opinions are better than one. I have every confidence that this treatment will work out well and I thank you for your support.&nbsp;&nbsp; : - )<BR>
