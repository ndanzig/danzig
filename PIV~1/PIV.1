THE POISON  I.V.  PAPERS:  I.

[This is the first of a series of occasional journalistic entries concerning 
the recent fortuitous discovery of cancer cells in my abdomen, and my struggle 
to put this shocking, new condition into perspective.   The presentation will 
be honest and in my own particular style.  Phillip Danzig]

Howard Stern went 'off the air' recently for using obscenity, scatology, 
'pushing the envelop too far' and other excess which have characterized and 
obsessed the psycho-sexual landscape of the entire 20th Century.  He was brought 
down by a combination of Orthodox, Fundamentalist Christian and outraged secular 
citizens and the FTC, cheered on, no doubt, by the growing group of 
Fundamentalist Muslims here in the USA.  

But there are several other sets of words which remain largely 'in the 
closet,' beyond the pale and spoken of mainly in hushed terms.  Among these, I have 
recently become personally familiar with 'Chemotherapy,' 'Metastasis,' and 
'Cancer.'

Following a routine CAT Scan this past January, to probe my long standing 
Crohn's Disease,  my Doctor informed me that ‘evidence of  masses were found in 
my liver.’   My previous scan, the previous February, had shown nothing.   
Profoundly shocked,  I asked, "Is this a tumor?"   'No,'  he said.  

Feeling my head entering hyperspace, I quietly asked,   "Are we talking ... 
Cancer ?"    'Yes,' came the clinical reply.

"Liver Cancer ?"  'No, these cells have originated elsewhere.'

Then it’s spreading, I thought.    With my voice echoing from somewhere 
between Jupiter and Neptune,  I forced myself to ask,   “Then, where are they 
coming from ?”    'We don't know that, yet,' the Doctor said, ‘but the good news 
is, we found it early.’  

Unable to distract my head with further questions, tears welled into my eyes. 
  Janet, the nurse, gave me a needed hug and said, "Don't worry, we'll stay 
with you through this.. ..'

"Okay,” I thought:   “I might live three months, 13 months, or 30 years.  
Or, the proverbial elevator cable could snap when I return home, today."

I confided in only a few close friends, waiting to get more factual 
information.  My alementary canal wa probed from top and bottom:  An Endoscopy proved 
Negative [in medical parliance, 'Negative,'  is often actually 'positive’ - ‘
Nothing Found']  as did a Colonoscopy.  A liver biopsy
suggested the small bowel or the pancreas as the organ of origin.  My 
Gastroenterologist suggested I select an Oncologist.

Several days had passed.  It was time to inform my three sons.   I  pointed 
out the absence of a
firm diagnosis, but emphasized the presence of several hopeful avenues I was 
already pursuing.  
I spoke with  some knowledgeable members of my congregation, the Town and 
Village Synagogue.   One mystical tradition holds that every congregation 
contains a Tsadik [Righteous
One] and a Roshe [Wicked One]:  What I soon learned, however,  was that Town 
and Village also held a Professor of Cell Biology at the New York University 
Medical Center, and the
Director of Research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering.   They helped me to set up 
a consultation at Memorial S-K a week later.

But I also mentioned my predicament to Rabbi Meir Fund, whose Kaballah 
classes I have attended for over three years.  I have provided some minor 
architectural assistance for his
newly-located, "Flatbush Minyan,” and I am one of the few in the class who 
had attended services and concerts of his great friend, Rabbi Schlomo Carlebach.

"Unbelievable !" Rabbi Fund told me.  "I know an Oncologist who has achieved 
amazing successes.  You must see him."  Next day, I phoned the office of Dr. 
Howard Bruckner to make
an appointment.  'And who is the Recommending Physician ?' I was asked.  
"Rabbi Meir Fund,”  I replied.  I had an appointment in three days. 

Checking around I found that Dr. Bruckner had, indeed, a major reputation.  
Trained at Yale, formerly on the staff at Mt. Sinai, he was now Director of 
Medical Oncology at the Lutheran Medical Center, in Brooklyn.   “Brooklyn?”   I 
thought, “that’s where I was born.  I’m going home.”  And half-a-dozen 
people I talked to spoke highly of Doctor Bruckner, including my medical contacts 
at T&V.  All mentioned his ‘unorthodox treatments’ and unusual successes.

I prepared for the consultation.
