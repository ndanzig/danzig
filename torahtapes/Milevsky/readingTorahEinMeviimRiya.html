<h2> Summery of Reading Torah and Hair Covering and Ein Meviim Raya min HaMaaseh </h2>


<p>If the Baal Kria is sick who ever fills in my like to read from a chumash and turn back and read from the Torah Scroll.  Is this permitted?
The Klosenberger Rebbe did just that and he did it on a regular basis.  His torah reading took a very long time, perhaps several hours.

<p>Can we bring a Rayya from a maaseh ( a proof from an example)? In cases
 where there is no halachic reason not to follow an example of a great Rabbi 
we certainly can and do use a Maaseh to determine our behavior.  For example <em>some</em> of the students of the Gr'A said that the Gr'A sat for Havdala.
Here there is no reason not to sit for havdala so we can learn from his behavior.  But when the practice regards an issue which itself in in halachic dispute,
we should not use an anecdote to decide the issue.

<p> If you read teh Tshuvot of Rav Moshe Feinstein on the subject of reading from a chumash and then turning back to read from the Torah, you will find that he forbids it. He consideres it as though you are still reading from the chumash even when you turn away.  Any out loud reading which is within toch kadei dibur (about 2 seconds ) of reading from a chumash is still considered that you read from a chumash, even if immediately after looking in the chumash you looked at the scroll of the torah. essentially , your abilty yo say what you are saying, the knowledge imparted to you came from the chumash, not the Torah scroll.
