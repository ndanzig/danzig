<h2>Writing a file in Tomcat
</h2>
<p>
If you attempt to write a file from your servlet, you need to specify 
where the file will be.  Since the file will actually be written by 
the Tomcat server, the place is determined by teh Tomcat
configuration file.  At JCT the files will be written in the 
directory:
<p>/usr/local/tomcat/users/<i>username</i>/ 

<p>


The owner of the file will be the user tomcat. Therefore, the only way to modify the files there is through your servlet.
