<h2>Abstract Factory </h2>
<p>
Instead of creating in main the child Jet and Heater and tank
which would mean that if I changed the child jet I would need to 
change my main.
<p>
Instead main calls to factory instance  and that factory is tailored to 
the new child jet,tank, heater.  It will in turn call the child jet
 and child tank etc.
<p>
I make an instance of child factory (hackme factory)  in main and call its 
functions to create the jet, tank, etc. .
<p>
The abtract factory is responsible to create an instance of his child. (you will need a predefinition of the children.)
 <p>
We can then add singleton to the abstract factory so that it will only create
one child.
<p>
Now if I add a new Jet, I will change code in abstract factory to 
create a different child factory instance. In

 dishwasher class  the code looks like this
<blockquote> itsHeater = AbstractFactory::theFactory(1)->createHeater() </blockquote>

the only change you need to make is the 1 can be 2 if you want a different dishwasher. 

<h2>Door Alarm </h2>

<p>each button press is within l
each button press enters a number. It is an event.
