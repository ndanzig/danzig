<h3>Setting up DNS domains at JCT<h3>
<ol>
<li>On the DNS primary server (zevach) make a zone file with a name like newdomain.zone in 
directory /var/named.
(this file may need to have mode 644, but I am not sure)
See an example <a href = "./example_dns_zone.txt"> file </a></li>
<li>edit /etc/named.conf to include this domain.  Define the domain as master
or slave, allow or deny updates, etc.

<ul><LI> master when we are the origin of dns authority 
<li>slave when we resolve domains on another server.


</ul>
<li> add lines like:
<br>
<table >
<tr><td> acad     IN     NS      zevach.jct.ac.il. <td> </tr>
<tr><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     IN     NS      yad.jct.ac.il. <td></tr>
</table>
to /var/named/jct.zone
<br>
This tells the name server from where to get info
on subdomain.  Note that we tell it to go itself; if so, why do this?
I think it's because the name server has to look in a
different zone file.




<li>restart named with a kill -HUP PID command</li>



</ol>

<ul>On UNIX servers and on all UNIX DNS clients do the following: 
<li>edit /etc/resolv.conf to search the new zone
 so that users may specify the host name without its
subdomain.  
</li>
<li>Note also that we're limited.  From resolv.conf(4) man page on zevach:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;           The search list is currently limited  to  six  domains <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;           and a total of 256 characters.

A related parameter in /etc/resolv.conf is "ndots".  This parameter
says: if a name has less than N dots in it, we assume it's *not* a
FQDN, so we try appending the domains listed in the "search"
parameter.  Here is an example from zevach's /etc/resolv.conf:

<br>
  ----------------------------------------------------
<br>     #       Because we have subdomains, set "ndots" to "2", so it's clear
<br>     #       that a host name is *not* considered to be a FQDN unless it
<br>     #       has at least 2 dots.
<br>     #
<br>     options ndots:2
<br>     ----------------------------------------------------

</li>

</ul>
