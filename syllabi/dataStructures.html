<h3>Syllabus</h3>

<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p style="width: 400px;">  Data Structures is a first year computer science which assumes an inroductory knowledge of C++.
The course must be taken concurrently with Advanced C++. The course goal is to provide a solid background 
in algorithms for computer science students.
The course also discusses principles of Object
Oriented Programming design and what purpose each concept serves.  Algorithms are evaluated using 
Big O and Little O notation.
The course covers various algorithms used to sort search or otherwise structure data nodes. 
These algorithms include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Linked Lists
<li>LIFO / FIFO
<li>Binary Search Trees
<li>Priority Queues
<li>Red Black Trees
<li>AVL Tree

</ul>
