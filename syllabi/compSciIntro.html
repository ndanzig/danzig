<h3>Syllabus</h3>

<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p style="width: 400px;">  Introduction to Computer Science in C++ is a first year computer science 
course designed to teach  the basic concepts of computer science and Object Oriented Programming.  
A basic explanation of how a computer is built and runs is given.  Details of the syntax
of the C++ programming language including virtually all keywords and operators are taught.  Loops, arrays, and
 functions are covered in depth. String manipulation functions are
explained and re-implemented. 

<p> The course also  covers:
<ul>
<li> The fundamentals of structured programming
<li> Functional programming
<li> Object oriented programming design
<li> Sorting algorithms
<li> Recursion
</ul>

<p>There 
is an extensive accompanying lab which includes many serious projects and utilizes all subjects covered with practical examples.
