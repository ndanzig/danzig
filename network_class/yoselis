dani, 

I spoke to you on tuesday afternoon (4.4) about the fact that my partner
had quit the lab, and wether I should continue by myself or join another
couple. (all that in case there is no other lone programer about).
the reason that i addressed you so late is that i was considering leaving
the course as well, due to some time consuming matters, but at the
end, i decided to stay).
i would appreciate it if you will be able to find out if there is a person
that doesn't have a partner before you leave for miluim.
meanwhile, i am working on the program, and i would like to know if there
will be a possibility of delaying the due date in case there will be a
need to,  and what are the ramifications of being late.

                               sincerely
