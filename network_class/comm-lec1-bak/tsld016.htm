 <H1>The LCR Parity Bits</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>Bit 3: Parity enable bit.
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>0: no parity bit sent
<LI>1: parity bit sent
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Bit 4: Chooses between odd and even parity.
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>0: odd parity. The number of  '1's in the word is counted. If odd the parity bit is set, if even it isn't set.
<LI>1: even parity. The number of  '1's in the word is counted. If even the parity bit is set, if odd it isn't set.
<LI>For instance the word 11001011 has odd parity. So if parity is enabled (bit 3) and bit 4 is 0  (odd parity), the parity bit sent will be 1 and the receiver will check the data and expect to find a 1 in the parity bit.
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Bit 5: Sets the "sticky" parity bit. The parity bit is always the same value, "high" (1) or "low" (0). 
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>0: The parity bit is set by the input word.
<LI>1: The parity bit is 0 is bit 4 is 1, the parity bit is 1 if bit 4 is 0. This setting is permanent as long as bit 6 is set.</UL></UL></P>
