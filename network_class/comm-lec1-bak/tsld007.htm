 <H1>The UART 8250</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>OK, lets say we understood the previous slides. How does the CPU send signals through the serial port?
</H2>

<LI><H2>A UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is used. The UART is a device that the CPU programs to perform tasks for it.

<LI><H2>In our case the UART 8250 is the device that controls the serial port. The 8250 is the first of a family that contains the 8250B, 16450, 16550 and others.

<LI><H2>The 8250 was introduced with the XT PC, so your computer probably has a later version. But all are backward compatible, so we can program as though we have a 8250.</H2>
