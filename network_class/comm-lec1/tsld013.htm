 <H1>Baud Rate</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>The rate of transfer is in BPS. The UART 8250 has a clock that's rate is 1.8432 MHz. The UART divides the clock signal by 16, giving a maximum baud of 115,200 BPS. 
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>But this rate might be too fast for some devices, so the rate is controllable.
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Lets say we want to communicate at 2400 BPS. We have to divide the clock rate by a number multiplied by 16 to get the desired rate. This number is called the baud rate. 
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Thus in our case 2400 = 1.8432*106/(baud rate * 16). 
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The baud rate = 1.8432*106/(2400 * 16) = 48
</H2>
</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>The baud rate is stored in the DLL and DLM before transmission starts. The DLL Contains the 8 LSBs (Least Significant Bits) and the DLM contains the 8 MSBs (Most Significant Bits).</H2>
