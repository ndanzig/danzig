 <H1>RS-232C Waves</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>So far we have introduced RS-232 Communications in relation to the PC. RS-232 communication is asynchronous. That is a clock signal is not sent with the data. Each word is synchronized using it's start bit, and an internal clock on each side (defined by the baud rate) reads the data.

<LI><H2>The signal is in the logical 1 state (also called "mark"), a start bit which is in logical state 0 (also called "space") signals that data is about to be sent. Then 8 bits of data are sent (this can be changed), a parity bit is optional (not shown here) and the a stop bit (or bits) is sent. This is called a frame (מסגרת). The data is framed between a stop and start bit.
