<ol TYPE=I>
<li>Introduction</li>
<ol TYPE=A>
<li>Dynamic Web Pages</li>
<p>In the beginning, man created the Internet. And the Internet was basically 
text and had to be updated manually. And the programmers said "There shall be 
Dynamic Web Pages" and there were Dynamic Web Pages.</p>
<p>The page you are currently viewing is a classic example of a dynamic web
page. If you look at the top of the page you see the words 'Last Updated:' 
followed by a date. If you looked at the source of the page you might think 
that I actually edit that date every time I make an update to the page but
in reality, the web page checks to see when it was last updated and writes in
the date <i>DYNAMICALLY</i>.</p> 
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>There are several methods for implementing dynamic web pages each of which 
usually falls into one of the following categories:</p>
<ol TYPE=1>
<li>CGI Programs</li>
<p>Dynamic web pages began with the creation of the <b>C</b>ommon 
<b>G</b>ateway <b>I</b>nterface. This let people point their web browsers 
at a program on a webserver and see the output inside their browser window.</p>
<p>For example the following Perl program is <a href="hw.pl">here</a></p>
<code>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello World\n";
</pre>
</code>
<p>The advantages of CGI programs are that they are run on the server itself 
(aka Server Side). This means that:
<p><ul>
<li>They can be written in <i>any</i> programming language understood 
by the webserver.</li>
<li>They also have access to all the resources available to the server 
itself.</li>
<li>The program code is hidden from people visiting the web site.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The disadvantages of CGI programs are that they are regular computer 
programs, in every way. This means that:
<p><ul>
<li>They must output an <i>entire</i> webpage including the HTML Headers
(ie. the first line of the CGI above- Content-Type, blah blah).
<li>CGI programs are also slow and consume resources because they spawn
a new process for every time they are run.
</ul>
</p>
<li>Client Side Scripting</li>
<p>Client Side Scripting languages like JavaScript and vbscript came next.
Without changing anything about how web pages were handled by web servers, 
browser companies started competing by adding script processing capabilities 
into their browsers. They hoped that the more wizardry their browsers could 
manage,the more websites would force people to use their web browsers. They 
were right.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that you can write a script inside your web
page, known as <i>inline</i>, and the web browser will process it before it 
shows the website in the web browser. 
Since the processing happens inside the web browser, this is called a 
<i>Client</i> Side Script.</p>
<p>The upside of this is that it costs no processing time on the Server Side. 
<p>The downside of this Client Side processing is that on the client side the
access to Server Side resources is necessarily limited and the web browser
must be able to see the code of my script.</p>
<li>Server Side Scripting</li>
<p>Both the CGI programs and the Client Side Scripts still have their places
but they each have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Server Side Scripts combine the best of both worlds. They are processed on 
the <i>server</i> so the code is hidden from the web browser and they have 
access to everything the server does (just like CGI programs). They are written
inline, so they only need to handle the dynamic parts of the web page, taking 
up less resources (like Client Side Scripts).</p></ul>   
</ol>
<li>Web Programming with Databases</li>
<p>Dynamic Web Pages are often used to provide a Database interface. Some 
common examples are:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.Com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dosidate.co.il">Dosidate</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>These examples are called "Extranet Database Applications". They allow
the World to access some of the data located in Amazon.Com's Databases. 
The nature of this access requires a Server Side implementation of Dynamic Web 
Pages in other words- if you want your web page to use a database think 
<b>Server Side Scripting</b>.</p>
<li>Project</li>
<ol type="1">
<li>In General</li>
<p>Dynamic Web Pages can also be used to build "Intranet Database 
Applications." These allow many people <i>inside</i> an organization to use the
same centrally located database from anywhere in the world. It is basically the
same as an <i>Extranet</i> Application except that its use is not open to 
people outside the organization.</p>
<p>In this course, you will be writing a complete Intranet Database 
Application. You will use HTML to create an interface. You will learn the 
Server Side Scripting language <b>PHP</b> which you will use to connect your
HTML Interface to a <b>MySQL</b> database.</p>
<li>Project Specifics (5763)</li>
<p>There are many methods for teaching autistic children. One method called ABA
(Applied Behavioral Analysis) takes a very scientific approach to the 
child's learning.</p>
<p>Everything the child is taught is organized into Learning 
Programs. Each program consists of several components such as the materials 
required, the response expected from the child, the correction that is to be 
made in the case of an incorrect response.</p>
<p>Each time a program is taught, it is repeated some number of times. Each 
repetition is called a Learning Unit. During the lesson the teacher records on
a data sheet the correct or incorrect responses.</p>
<p>This data is graphed and used to chart the child's progress. If the 
child succeeds in achieving 90% accuracy two days in a row, The Learning 
Program is changed for the positive- it is made harder, etc. If the child does
not improve or shows dropping accuracy, the Learning Program is changed for
the negative- it is made easier, etc.
<p>In an ABA school, two or more teachers may be teaching one child. All 
teachers who teach a child, record data on the same data sheets.</p>
<p>With an Intranet Database Application:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>All the teachers could use a web interface to input their data straight 
into one database.</li>
<li>The data could be graphed automatically by the computer instead of by 
hand.</li>
<li>The computer could notify the teacher automatically when the child has
succeeded or failed a Learning Program.</li>
</ol>      
	</ol>
	<li>PHP 1</li>
<p>PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Processor" it is one of the two major Server Side scripting languages. The other is ASP. PHP is partially based on Perl, C, and Java. You can find more information on PHP at the PHP Website: <a href="http://www.php.net">http://www.php.net</a></p>
	<ol TYPE=A>
		<li>Inline Scripting</li>
<p>As we said, one of the major advantanges to Server Side scripting languages is that you can include your code inline with the HTML of your web pages.</p>
<p>If you haven't already guessed, we do this by enclosing our code in some special tags.
This is called <b>Escaping from HTML</b>. This is similar to what we do for regular HTML Tags where we <i>escape</i> from the text. The only difference is that the tags we use to include our PHP code are meant to be interpreted by our web server unlike HTML Tags which are interpreted by our web browsers.</p>
		<ol TYPE=1>
			<li>Escaping from HTML &lt;?php ..... ?&gt;</li>
<p>We must begin any of our inline PHP code with &lt;?php</p>
<p>We must end any of our inline PHP code with ?&gt;</p>
<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<xmp>
<html>
<head>
<title>My First PHP Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<!--
     Here I escape from the HTML inside the body and print 
     something into the web page. It should show up like regular
     Body text
-->

<?php print "Hello World"; ?>

<h1>
<!--
     Here I escape from the HTML inside the h1 and print 
     something into the web page. It should show up like h1 text
-->

<?php print "Hello World"; ?>

</h1>
</body>
</html>

			<li>Statement Separation &lt;?php statement 1; statement 2; ?&gt;</li>
<p>Just like it's "Parent" languages, statements in PHP are separated by semi-colons. 
Here is an example of multiple statements:</p>
<xmp>
<html>

</head>
<body>

<?php

// btw: comments in PHP are like comments in C

print "Hello World";          //Statement #1
print "<br>Hello World";      //Statement #2

/*
   Notice the <br> tag- without it I would have printed
   Hello WorldHelloWorld
*/

?>

</body>

		</ol>
		<li>Variables</li>
<p>In any programming language, there are two types of data:
<b>Variables</b> and <b>Constants</b>.</p>
<p><b>Constants</b> stay constant. In the PHP example above, the text
which we gave the print function ("Hello World") was a constant. From
the time the PHP script began to run until it finished, that text
stayed exactly the same.</p>
<p><b>Variables</b> are more interesting. They are the heart of any programming language. When the programmer creates a variable named 'x', he tells the computer to set aside a piece of memory and call it 'x'. From then on he can <b>assign</b> a value to the variable 'x' and the computer will place that value in the memory set aside for the variable.</p>
		<ol TYPE=1>
			<li>Syntax</li>
<p>Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive. Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.</p>
<p>Exactly how much memory the computer sets aside for a variable and how that memory is used is dependant on a characteristic of the variable called the <b>Variable Type</b>. We'll discuss types in a little bit.</p>
<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<xmp>
<html>
<head>
<title>My Third PHP Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<?php

$var="Hello World";   //Assign the value 'Hello World' to the variable $var 
print "Aren't you glad I didn't print $var?\n"; //use the variable

?>

</body>
</html>
</xmp>
<p>Click <a href="ex3.php">here</a> to see how this example would appear in your browser.</p> 
			<li>Scope</li>
<p>Variables necessarily have a characteristic called <b>Scope</b>,
that is where in a program the variable name is recognized and where
it isn't. When a variable is in scope, it's like Norm going to
"Cheers" - a place where everybody knows your name. If you would
scream Norm in The Underground, chances are people wouldn't have a
clue what your were talking about. The same thing is true of a
variable. If you try to use a variable in scope- no problem. If you
try to use a variable out of scope, your program won't work if you're
lucky. If you're unlucky, your program will work incorrectly and you
won't know why.</p>
<p>The scope of a variable is the context within which it is
defined. For the most part all PHP variables only have a single Global
scope. However, within user-defined functions a local function scope
is introduced. Any variable used inside a function is by default
limited to the local function scope. You can get around this if you
really have to by declaring to PHP that you want to use the Global
version of a variable.</p>
<p>Let's see an example:</p> 
<xmp>
<html>
<head>
<title>My Fourth PHP Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<?php

$var="Global";   //Assign the value 'Global' to the variable $var 

print "Printing the $var scoped variable.\n<br>"; //use the variable

//write a function to change $var
function Test_1()
{
  $var="Local"; 
}
Test_1();

//did my function change $var?
print "Printing the $var scoped variable.\n<br>"; 

//write a better function to change $var
function Test_2()
{
  global $var;
  $var="Local"; 
}
Test_2();

//did my new function change $var?
print "Printing the $var scoped variable.\n<br>"; 

?>

</body>
</html>

		</ol>
		<li>Types</li>
<p>PHP is a softly typed language but don't worry- that doesn't mean
you loose points for typing loudly. What it does mean is that the
programmer does not usually worry about the format which PHP uses to
store data in memory. Where a programmer in Java or C would be
required to tell the compiler what kind of memory to allocate, in PHP
that is usually not necessary.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is still important to realize that data is
stored in one of several formats (traditionally called
<b>types</b>). PHP will automagically handle certain operations
differently depending on the data types involved (similar to
overloaded functions in C).</p> <ol TYPE=1> <li>Booleans</li>
<p>Booleans are the simplest type. They express a <b>truth value</b>,
and can contain either <b>TRUE</b> or
<b>FALSE</b>.
<p>$var=TRUE; $var=true; $var=FALSE; $var=false;</p>
<p>When other types are evaluated as truth values, they automatically
get converted (aka casted) as a boolean. See each type for it's
True/False values.</p> <li>Integers</li>
<p>An Integer is a number of the set <b>Z= {...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...}</b>.</p>
<p>$var = 613; $var = -100;</p>
<p>The size of an Integer is platform dependant. On 32 bit systems
like ours, the maximum value is about 2 billion. PHP does not support
unsigned integers.</p>
<p>If you specify a value for an integer that is out of bounds, it
will be converted to a float.  The same is true if you perform an
operation between integers that results in a value out of bounds for
an integer.</p>
<p>The integer 0 is considered false. Any non-zero integer is
considered true.</p> 
<li>Floating Points</li>
<p>Floating Point numbers (aka floats) are any numbers in the set R
(real numbers).</p>
<p>$var = 1.234; $var = 1.2e3; $var = 7E-10;</p>
<p>The size of a float is platform dependant. The maximum value is
commonly about 1.8e308 with a precision of 14 decimal places.</p>
<p>The float 0.0 is considered false. Any non-zero float is considered true.</p> 
<li>Strings</li>
<p>A string is a series of characters, each character taking up
exactly 1 byte.</p>
<p>PHP imposes no size limit on strings so they can be any size you
want (until your webserver runs out of memory). Strings are enclosed
in either single quotes (') or double quotes (&quot;). As in Perl,
strings enclosed within single quotes will be not be interpreted- they
will be accepted as is. Strings enclosed in double quotes, on the
other hand, will be interpreted and may contain variables or other
special characters.</p>
<p>Single Quote examples:</p>
<pre>
print 'this is a simple string';
print 'You can also have embedded newlines in strings
this way';
print 'Arnold once said: "I\'ll be back"';
// output: ... "I'll be back"
print 'I am trying to include at this point: \n a newline';
// output: ... this point: \n a newline
</pre>
<p>You may recognize some of the following special characters which can be 
used within a double quoted string:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td>\n</td><td>linefeed (LF or 0x0A (10) in ASCII)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\r</td><td>carriage return (CR or 0x0D (13) in ASCII)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\t</td><td>horizontal tab (HT or 0x09 (9) in ASCII)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\\</td><td>backslash<td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\$</td><td>dollar sign<td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\&quot;</td><td>double-quote<td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\[0-7]{1,3}</td><td>the sequence of characters matching the regular expression is a character in octal notation<td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\x[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,2}</td><td>the sequence of characters matching the regular expression is a character in hexadecimal notation<td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Double Quote Examples(mixed with some more variable syntax):</p>
<pre>
$beer = 'Heineken';
print "$beer's taste is great"; // works, "'" is an invalid character for varnames
print "He drank some $beers";   // won't work, 's' is a valid character for varnames
print "He drank some ${beer}s"; // works
</pre>
<p>The empty string "" as well as the string "0" are considered false. Any other string is considered true.</p>
			<li>Arrays</li>
<p>An array in PHP is actually an ordered map. A map is a type that maps values to keys. This type is optimized in several ways, so you can use it as a real array, or a list (vector), hashtable (which is an implementation of a map), dictionary, collection, stack, queue and probably more. Because you can have another PHP-array as a value, you can also quite easily simulate trees.</p>
<p>Unlike the other types we discussed, arrays must be created or declared. To create an array we use the array construct as follows:</p>
<pre>
//Numeric Keys(simple arrays like in C/Java)
$var = array('a', 'b', 'c');
print $var[0];  //outputs a
print $var[1];	//outputs b

//Change the starting key(index number)
$var = array(1 => 'a', 'b', 'c');
print $var[1];  //outputs a
print $var[2];  //outputs b

//Associative Arrays
$var = array('Moshe Rabeinu' => 'Navi', 'Rashi' => 'Rishon');
print $var['Moshe Rabeinu'];  //outputs Navi

//mix up the key types - no problem
$var = array(1 => 'a', 'Willy' => 'Wonka');
			
//Two Dimensional (Simple) Arrays

$var = array(
             array(1,2,3,4),
             array(1,2,3,4),
             array(1,2,3,4),
             array(1,2,3,4)
	     );

//This is the same as:

$col1 = array(1,2,3,4);
$col2 = array(1,2,3,4);
$col3 = array(1,2,3,4);
$col4 = array(1,2,3,4);

$var = array($col1, $col2, $col3, $col4);

//Two Dimensional (Associative) Arrays
$var = array( 'Joe Bloggs' => array( 'ID' => '00001',
                                     'STREET' => '123 Sesame St.',
				     'CITY' => 'Yourtown',
				     'COUNTRY' => 'Nowhere Land')
				     );
print $var['Joe Bloggs']['ID']; //outputs 00001
</pre>
<p>An array with 0 elements is considered false. Any other array is considered true.</p>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<li>PHP 2</li>
	<ol TYPE=A>
		<li>Operators</li>
<p>Operators make the programmer's life easier. If it weren't for
		operators, even the simplest action would require a
		full fledged function.</p>
<p>We will digress to briefly discuss functions. A function is basically
		a set of actions which is executed whenever the
		function is called. Functions can accept parameters
		and return values. For instance, a function 'add()'
		might accept two parameters 'a' and 'b' ( now we have
		add(a,b) ) and the function might return a value 'c' (
		c=add(a,b) meaning c=a+b).</p>
<p>We see directly from this example how operators make the
		programmer's job easier. It is much easier to write
		a+b as opposed to add(a,b). 
<p>On a deeper level, I challenge anyone in the class to write the function
		add(a,b) without using any of arithmetic operators we
		learn in class. Anyone with a working function by the
		end of the semester will recieve a bonus on their
		final grade.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, most of the operators we would want are already
		part of php.</p>
		<ol TYPE=1>
			<li>Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)</li>
<p>The arithmetic operators will do what you expect them to most of
			the time. '+' adds, '-' subtracts, '*' multiplies, '/'
			divides, '%' performs the modulus operation-
			that is (a % b) divides a by b and returns the
			remainder.</p>
<p>The <b>precedence</b> of the operators is the same as you would expect:
			(*,/,%) are performed first followed by (+,-)
			so that 1+5*3 is the same as 1+(5*3)=16. Even
			if the precedence of the operators says that
			your equation should work, you should still
			put parenthesis in the correct places to make
			your code more readable.
			<li>String</li>
<p>There is one main <i>String</i> Operator which is the '.'. The '.'
			Operator performs string concatenation which
			means that it glues strings together. In Java
			this is done with the '+' operator. For
			example:</p>
<pre>
$var = "Hello"." "."World";
print $var; //outputs Hello World

$var = $var."!";
print $var; //ouputs Hello World!
</pre>

			<li>Assignment (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, .=)</li>
<p>We've been using Assignment Operators since we learned about
			variables. '=' is the simplest of the
			Assignment Operators. It takes the value on
			the right hand side and assigns it to whatever
			is on the left hand side.</p>
<p>This brings up the issue of <b>Left Hand Values</b> and <b>Right
			Hand Values</b>. A Left Hand Value is anything
			that can have a value assigned to it. A Right
			Hand Value is anything with a value. <b>Every
			Left Hand Value is a Right Hand Value but NOT
			every Right Hand Value is a Left Hand
			Value.</b></p>
<pre>
$var = 5;  //works - $var is a LHV, 5 is a RHV
5 = $var;  //BAD! - 5 is a RHV only, I can't assign it a value
$a = $b = $c = 5; /*    works, I assign RHV 5 to LHV $c which becomes a
			RHV to be assigned to $b... */
</pre>
<p>Now that you know that the '=' sign is an Operator, we understand
how we can write something like $var = $var."!"; in the example
above. The '.' Operator has higher <b>precedence</b> than the '='
operator. As a matter of fact, since we almost always want the entire RHV to
be calculated before it's assigned we have to give the '=' Operator
(and all the other Assignment Operators) very low precedence. If you
have a precedence problem or you want to be sure that something is
interpreted in a specific order, <b>use parenthesis</b></p>
<p>Other than the '=' Operator, we have some more complex Assignment
			Operators. All of them follow the same modus
			operandi. 'a += b' translates into a = a + b
			for example:</p>
<pre>
$a=5;
$a+=6;  // $a = 5 + 6
print $a; //outputs 11
</pre>
<p>The same is true for the '-=', '*=', '/=', and '.=' Operators.</p>
<li>Incrementation Operators(++,--)</li>
<p>Incrementation Operators are just shortcuts for incrementing a value. The ++ operator is the equivalent of adding 1 to a value while the -- operator is the equivalent of subtracting 1 from a value. For example:</p>
<pre>
$a=5;
$a++;     //$a=$a+1; OR $a+=1;
print $a; //outputs 6
$a--;     //$a=$a-1; OR $a-=1;
print $a  //outputs 5
</pre>
<p>An important thing to note about incrementation operators is that
they are unary operators, meaning that they only have one operand. The
operators + and - can also be unary operators, for example -5 meaning
negative 5. In this case the - is the unary operator - and the 5 is
its only operand. In the case of 5 - 4, on the other hand, we are
using the binary operator - and its two operands 5 and 4.</p>
<p>Another important thing to note about incrementation operators have
both a prefix syntax and a postfix syntax. What does that mean? The
other unary operator we just discussed, -, only has a meaning when you
<i>prefix</i> it to a number; -5 means negative 5 while 5- is
meaningless. With incrementation operators, this is not the case. --$a
means something slightly different from $a--. The easiest way to see
this is in an example:</p>
<pre>
$a=5;
print $a++;  //outputs 5, THE SAME AS: print $a; $a=$a+1; 
print $a;    //outputs 6
print ++$a;  //outputs 7, THE SAME AS: $a=$a+1; print $a;
</pre> 
			<li>Comparison (==,!=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=,
			&gt;=, ?:)</li>
<p>Comparison Operators return <b>Truth Values</b>. 
<ul>
<li>'a == b' tests if a is equal to b
<li>'!=' - not equal</li>
<li> '&lt;' - less than</li>
<li> '&gt;' - greater than</li>
<li> '&lt;=' - less than or equal to</li>
<li> '&gt;=' - greater than or equal to.</li>
</ul>
<p>The operator ?: is a special kind of operator called the Ternary
Operator. It takes three operands and is used as follows:</p>
<pre>
$a=1;
$b = ($a > 0) ? "Positive" : "Negative";
print $b; //outputs Positive
</pre>
<p>Read the above as "If ($a > 0) then assign 'Positive' to $b else
assign 'Negative' to $b"</p>
<p><b>Beware</b> using the comparison operators on strings. You might
		get unexpected answers. For instance if you
		compare the number 0 to the string
		"0000000000" php will consider them the same
		because it converts the string to a number and
		the numbers are equal. If you compare the
		string "01" and "001", they will also match
		for the same reason- that numerically they are
		equal. The correct way to compare strings is
		by using the function strcmp() which we'll
		learn later.</p>
			<li>Logical (!, &amp;&amp;, ||)</li>
<p>Logical Operators are used to manupulate <b>Truth Values</b>. The
		three basic logical operators are:</p>
<ul>
<li>! - NOT</li>
<li>&amp;&amp; - AND</li>
<li>|| - OR</li>
</ul>
<p>The following truth table shows all the possible combinations of
output(0 is false, 1 is true):
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td>a</td><td>b</td><td>!a</td><td>a&&b</td><td>a||b</td>

		<li>Conditionals</li>
		<ol TYPE=1>
			<li>if(true){statements}elseif(true){statements}else{statements}</li>
<p><b>Conditionals</b> allow the programmer to perform different sets
of statements based on the values of relavent parameters. The syntax
is:</p>
<pre>
if(Truth Value == TRUE)
{
  //statements to do seperated by ';'
}
elseif(Truth Value == TRUE)
{
  //statements to do seperated by ';'
}
else
{
  //statements to do seperated by ';'
}
</pre>
<p>Using an <b>if</b> statement does not require using an
			<b>elseif</b> statement nor does it require
			using an <b>else</b> statement.</p>
<p>You may have as many <b>elseif</b> statements as you want following an
			<b>if</b> statement.</p>
<p>You may only have <i>ONE</i> <b>else</b> statement following an
			<b>if</b> statement.</p>
<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<xmp>
<?php

$a=-1;
if($a>0)
{
  print "Positive";
}
elseif($a == 0)
{
  print "Zero";
}
else
{
  print "Negative";
}

?>

			<li>switch($var){case x: statements; break;
			default: statements; break;}</li>
<p><b>Switch Case</b> statements are like <b>if</b> statements that
		have been optimised for the situation where the
		programmer wants to test the same expression for many
		possible values. The syntax is:</p>
<pre>
switch(RHV1)  //if RHV1 ==
{
   case RHV2:  //this RHV then
   //do the folowing statements seperated by ';' 
     break;   //leave the switch
   case RHV3:  
     break;
   ...
   case RHVn:
     break;
   default:   //if nothing else matches do this
     //do the folowing statements seperated by ';' 
}
</pre>
<p>Any expression can go inside the <b>switch</b>. The computer goes
		through the <b>case</b>s in order looking for a case
		that returns TRUE for the comparison ((expression from
		switch)&nbsp;==&nbsp;(value from case)).</p>
<p>If the computer reaches a <b>case</b> which matches, it performs
		the set of statements beneath it until it finds a
		<b>break</b> statement. <b>BEWARE</b> if you forget to
		put a <b>break</b> statement at the end of your case
		the computer will continue with the statements under
		the next <b>case</b> statement. If this is used
		properly, it is a feature- not a bug. See the example
		above.
<p>The programmer can also use a <b>default</b> case. This case is put
		at the end of all the cases and it will always match
		in case no other cases matched.
<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<xmp>
<?php

$lucky_number=7;
switch($lucky_number)
{
 case -1:
 case -2:
 case -3:   //for all these cases do this
   print "Don't be so negative!";
   break;   //the break tells me to leave the switch
 case 0:
   print "You're a 0!";
   break;   
 case 1:
   print "You're Number 1!";
   break;
 case 2:
   print "Two's Company!";
   break;
 case 3:
   print "Three's a crowd!";
   break;
 case 4:
   print "Why have you 4saken me?";
   break;
 case 5:
   print "High 5!";
   break;
 case 6:
   print "Pickup Stix!";
   break;
 case 7:
   print "That's MY Lucky Number!";
   break;
 case 8:
   print "Crazy Eights!";
   break;
 case 9:
   print "Only cats have 9 lives!";
   break;

		</ol>
		<li>Loops</li>
<p><b>Loops</b> allow the programmer to perform the same set of statements a
		multiple number of times. The most common problem with
		<b>loops</b> is the <i>infinite</i> loop in which the
		computer is caught in a loop which never ends. In order to
		prevent infinite loops, we say that every loop must
		have three elements:
<ol type="1">
<li>Initialization</li>
<p>Initialize the variables on which the loop is dependant(usually a
variable used in the <b>continue condition</b>).</p>
<li>Continue Condition</li>
<p>In each iteration, this condition is checked to see whether or
not the computer should perform another iteration. If the condition is found to be
true, then the loop continues.</p>
<li>Incrementation</li>
<p>In each iteration, something must be incremented to bring the loop
closer to completion(usually the variable used in the <b>continue
condition</b>).</p>
</ol>
<p>There are several ways to implement loops:</p>
		<ol TYPE=1>
			<li>while(true){statements}</li>
<p>The <b>while</b> loop is the simplest of all loops. It's syntax is
			as follows:</p>
<pre>
while(continue_condition == TRUE)
{
   //do some statements seperated by ';'
}
</pre>
<p>The <b>Initialization</b> usually takes place before the while loop
actually begins. The <b>Continue Condition</b> is located within the
parenthesis. As long as that condition evaluates to TRUE, the loop
will continue to iterate. The <b>Incrementation</b> in a while loop
usually takes place at the beginning or the end of the loop but it can
take place anywhere inside.</p>
<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<xmp>
<?php

//Initialization
$i=1;

//Continue Condition
while($i<=10)   //Is $i <= 10????
{

  print "$i\n"; //print $i

  //Incrementation
  $i++;
  
}

?></xmp>
<p>Click <a href="ex8.php">here</a> to see how this example would appear in your browser.</p>  

			<li>do{statements}while(true);</li>
<p>A <b>do..while</b> loop is basically the same as a <b>while</b>
			loop except that the continue condition is
			only checked at the end of each iteration and
			therefore the set of commands within the loop
			will always be executed at least once. For example:</p>
<xmp>
<?php

print "<br>Doing first loop<br>";
//Initialization
$i = 1;
do {
  /*
    There is no Incrementation in this loop
  */
   print $i;
} while ($i>1); //Continue Condition

print "<br>Doing second Loop<br>";

//Initialization
$i = 1;
do {
  
   print "$i\n";
   $i++;     //Incrementation

} while ($i<=10); //Continue Condition

?></xmp>
<p>Click <a href="ex9.php">here</a> to see how this example would appear in your browser.</p>  
			<li>for(init;continue;increment){statements}</li>
<p>A <b>for</b> loop is more complex than the <i>while</i> style
			loops. It contains all three elements of a
			loop in it's opening clause. It's syntax is as
			follows:</p>
<pre>
for(Initialization;Continue Condition;Incrementation)
{
  //statements seperated by ';'
}
</pre>
<p>When the <b>for</b> loop begins it performs the initialization in
			the first section of the opening clause and
			checks the Continue Condition. If the Continue
			condition returns TRUE then the program
			performs the statements in the loop. When it
			reaches the end of the iteration, it performs
			the incrementation in the third section of the
			opening clause and checks the Continue
			Condition again.</p>
<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<xmp>
<?php

for($i=1;$i<=10;$i++)
{
  print "$i\n";
}

?></xmp>
<p>Click <a href="ex10.php">here</a> to see how this example would appear in your browser.</p>  
			<li>foreach(array as $value){statements}</li>
<p>The <b>foreach</b> loop is optimized for looping through
			arrays. Since arrays in PHP have a complex
			syntax, the <b>foreach</b> loop has two
			syntaxes. 
<p>The simple syntax is most usefull for numerically indexed arrays
			where the index of the array is not of any
			significance to the program. In such a
			situation, a programmer would most likely have
			used a <b>for</b> loop with an incremented
			variable to reference each index of the
			array.With the <b>foreach</b> loop, there is
			no need for an extra variable to track the
			index of the array because it is done
			internally.</p>
<p>With a regular <b>for</b> loop the programmer would also have to
reference the element of the array using array syntax,
ie. $array[$index]. With a <b>foreach</b> loop, the value of each element is
automagically assigned to a variable for use within the loop.</p>
<p>The <i>simple</i> syntax of a <b>foreach</b> loop is as
follows:</p>
<pre>
foreach($array_name as $current_element_value)
{
  //statements seperated by ';'
}
</pre>
<p>The corresponding <b>for</b> loop would look like:</p>
<pre>
for($i=0;$i<=LAST_INDEX_OF_ARRAY;$i++)
{
  $current_element_value=$array_name[$i];
  //statements seperated by ';'
}
</pre>

			<li>foreach(array as $key=&gt;$value){statements}</li>
<p>When the programmer is interested in the <i>index</i> or <b>key</b>
			of the array as well as the value of the
			element, the complex foreach syntax is a good
			choice. It will store the value of the current
			key and the current element in variables for
			use inside the loop.</p>
<p>The <i>complex</i> syntax of a <b>foreach</b> loop is as
follows:</p>
<pre>
foreach($array_name as $key => $current_element_value)
{
  //statements seperated by ';'
}
</pre>
<p>There is <b>NO</b> corresponding <b>for</b> loop.</p>

<p>NOTE: This way we save ourselves making total equal -1 and the continue which we needed so we don't mess up and count the date as one of the answers.</p> 
			<li>break, continue</li>
<p>The <b>break</b> statement simply exits the current loop or switch statement. For example:</p>
<pre>
$a=1;
while($a<=10)
{
  if($a>5)
  {
   break;
  }
  print $a++;
}
</pre>
<p>break also takes a numeric argument which is the number of levels to exit from. In the above example we could also have typed 'break 1;' to break out of one level of loops.</p>
<p>The <b>continue</b> statement skips to the next iteration of a loop. Like the <b>break</b> statement, it also works inside switch statements but you should never use it there because it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<pre>
$a=1;
while($a<=10)
{
  if($a>5)
  {
   continue;
  }
  print $a++;
} 
</pre>
		</ol>
<li>
PHP has many functions for doing many things.  See <a href="http://www.php.net/">php.net</a> for a complete reference.  Here I will give you two simple examples of reading and writing to text files.

<xmp>

<?php
$filename = 'test.txt';
$content = "Add this text to the file\n";

// Make sure the file exists and is writable first.
if (is_writable($filename) == FALSE ) {
       echo "The file $filename is not writable";
       exit;
} 
   // In our example we're opening $filename in append mode.
   // The file pointer is at the bottom of the file hence
   // that's where $somecontent will go when we fwrite() it.

if (!$handle = fopen($filename , 'a')) {
         echo "Cannot open file ($filename)";
         exit;
   }

 // Write $somecontent to our opened file.
if (fwrite($handle, $somecontent ) === FALSE) {
       echo "Cannot write to file ($filename)";
       exit;
   }
  
   echo "Success, wrote ($somecontent) to file ($filename)";
  
   fclose($handle);

}
?>


fread() reads up to length bytes from the file pointer referenced by handle. 
Reading stops when up to length bytes have been read, EOF (end of file) is 
reached, (for network streams) when a packet becomes available, or (after 
opening userspace stream) when 8192 bytes have been read whichever comes first.

Returns the read string or FALSE in case of error.

<?php
// get contents of a file into a string
$filename = "/usr/local/something.txt";
$handle = fopen($filename, "r");
$contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));
fclose($handle);
?> 

</xmp>
</li>

	</ol>
<li>Getting User Input</li>
	<ol TYPE=A>
	<li>HTML Forms</li> <a name="forms">
<p>An <b>HTML Form</b> allows a user to pass input through the web
browser to the web server where it can be processed. HTML Forms make
it possible to build an <b>Intranet Database Application</b>,
specifically they compose the <b>User Interface</b> of the application.</p>
<p>A form is defined with the &lt;form&gt; tag. A form must have both
	an opening tag and a closing tag. All form elements that
	belong to a form must be enclosed within the opening and
	closing tags. You <i>may</i> have more than one form on a
	page. You may <b>NOT</b> have a form within a form.</p>
<p>In the opening form tag, you must define two attributes for the
	form to work properly, the <b>method</b> and the
	<b>action</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>action</b> defines where to send the information for processing. In
	our case this will be a PHP page.</p>
<p>The <b>method</b> defines <i>how</i> to send the information. This
	can be either <b>get</b> or <b>post</b>.</p>
<ul>
<p>The <b>get</b> method sends the form contents in the address like:
	http://www.somewhere.com/myphp.php<b>?name=value&name=value</b>. This
	has several limitations:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Everyone can see what you send in your form</li>
	<li>The form values may not contain non-ASCII characters</li>
	<li>The form values may not exceed 100 characters</li>
	</ol>
<p>The <b>post</b> method sends the form contents in the body of the
request. This means that you can send anything you want this way. The
only downside is that most browsers are unable to bookmark post
requests.</p>
</ul>
<p>In most cases we will use the <b>post</b> method although sometimes
it is useful to send information to pages via the <b>get</b> method. Moreover,
if you want to get to a specific php page via a link from a non-form
html page, you will have to use get. </p>

<li>PHP and HTML Forms</li>
<p>Really there is very little to know about using PHP with forms. PHP
was made for this so it doesn't get easier. Three easy steps:
<ol type="1">
<li>Make your form in HTML</li>
<p>Remember that the names you give your form elements will be the
variable names in PHP with which you can access the values of the
input. That means you <b>MUST</b> use valid PHP variable names.</p>
<li>Write a PHP page that uses the input variables</li>
<li>Point your form at your PHP page</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here is an example of the source code of a form:
<xmp>
<html>
<head>
<title>Sample Form </title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Sample Form</h1>

<P>Please enter a  name  </p>

<form action="displayhello.php" method="POST" >
Name
<input type="text" name="username" size="10" maxlength="8" > 

<input type="submit" value="Click me!">

</form>
</body>
</html>
</xmp>
<p>
We see that the form tag has attribute action defining the php page which is to receive the 
data entered (displayhello.php) and the method how it receives it (POST).
You can also see two input tags.  The first one is used to create an input window on the 
web page for the user to type in his name.  The second is used to 
create a button for him to submit the data to the php page.  You will only have one button 
per form.  More about input type in the next section.

<p>
Now let's see the php page that handles the data.
<xmp>
<?php
print "<html>";

$name = $_POST["username"];

print "<body>";
print " hello $name";
print "</body>";
print "<html>";
</xmp>
<p>
Notice that the variable named in the form was "username".  So, in the php page we
get the data the user typed in from the variable named "username" also. For security reasons
php stores this information in an array.  The $_POST array is
used for post requests and the $_GET array is used for get requests.  Since we sent the 
information via a post, we have to look for it in the $_POST array.  You will notice that the 
array is an associative array, so we locate our data by its name, not by index 0.
<p>
Here is another php example which could be used with the sample form.  It mails an email:
<xmp>
<?php
print "<html>";

$name = $_POST["username"];
$sub="testmessage";
$message="
Name: $name ";
mail("BillGates@jct.ac.il",$sub,$message,"From: ESP Feedback <apache@cc.jct.ac.il>\n");

print "<body>";
print " Hello $name again. We sent mail to Bill Gates.";
print "</body>";
print "<html>";
</xmp>
<p>

<a href="sampleform.html">Test the sample form</a><br>
 

<li>Form Elements</li>
<p><b>Form Elements</b> define the types of information for
processing by the web server. There are several types of Form
Elements which, together, can be used to build a fully functional
interface:</p>
<ol type="1">
   <li>Text Fields - For entering one line of text</li>
   <p>To put a Text Field into our page we place the following
   <b>input</b> tag inside our form tags:
<xmp>
<input type="text" name="firstname">
</xmp>
<input type="text" name="firstname">
<p>This puts a default sized text field on the web
   page(type="text"). It gives the field the name 'firstname' which
   means that when we send the information to our PHP page, we will
   send it inside the variable $firstname.</p>
<p>In addition we could use the <b>value</b> attribute to give our
   text field a default value. We could use the <b>size</b> attribute
   to define how many characters wide the text field should be. We
   could use the <b>maxlength</b> attribute to define how many
   characters the field is willing to accept. For example:</p>
<xmp>
<input type="text" name="country" size="3" maxlength="2" value="IL">
</xmp>
<input type="text" name="country" size="3" maxlength="2" value="IL">
   <li>Textarea Fields - For entering multiple lines of text</li>
   <p>To put a Textarea Field into our page we place the following
   <b>textarea</b> tag inside our form tags:
<xmp>
<textarea rows="10" cols="30" name="comment">Default Text</textarea>
</xmp>
<textarea rows="10" cols="30" name="comment">Default Text</textarea>
<p>This puts a 10 row by 30 column textarea on the web page. It gives the
   field the name 'comment' which means that when we send the
   information to our PHP page, we will send it inside the variable
   $comment. <b>NOTE:</b> A textarea must be opened an closed. Default
   text may be placed in between the opening and closing tags.</p> 
   <li>Select Boxes - For selecting a choice from a list</li>
<p>To put a Select Box on our web page we place the following series
   of tags inside our form tags:</p>
<xmp>
<select name="area_code">
    <option value="Cellcom">058</option>
    <option value="Cellcom">052</option>
    <option value="Cellcom">053</option>
    <option value="Cellcom">064</option>
    <option value="Pelephone">051</option>
    <option value="Pelephone">056</option>
    <option value="Pelephone">050</option>
</select>
</xmp>
<select name="area_code">
    <option value="Cellcom">058</option>
    <option value="Cellcom">052</option>
    <option value="Cellcom">053</option>
    <option value="Cellcom">064</option>
    <option value="Pelephone">051</option>
    <option value="Pelephone">056</option>
    <option value="Pelephone">050</option>
</select>
<p>This creates a drop down menu with 7 options. The options that
   appear in the list are written in between the <b>option</b>
   tags. Which ever choice is selected, the <i>VALUE</i> of that
   option is put into the variable, in this case $area_code.</p>
<p>We could also have used the <b>multiple</b> attribute of the select
   tag to allow multiple choices to be selected(multiple="true").</p>
   <li>Radio Buttons - For selecting one of a limited number of
   choices</li>
<p>To put a <b>set</b> of Radio Buttons on our web page we place the
   following <b>set</b> of input tags inside our form tags:</p>
<xmp>
Male: <input type="radio" name="Sex" value="Male" checked>
Female: <input type="radio" name="Sex" value="Female">
</xmp>
Male: <input type="radio" name="Sex" value="Male" checked>
Female: <input type="radio" name="Sex" value="Female">
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Both input tags have the same name. This is what
   connects them so that only one of the choices can be selected at a
   time. Which ever one is checked when the form is sent to be
   processed will send it's value inside the variable. The
   <b>checked</b> attribute selects a default selection.</p>
   <li>Checkboxes - For selecting one or more of a limited number of
   choices</li>
<p>To put a Checkbox on our web page, we put the following input tag
   inside our forms tags:</p>
<xmp>
Check Me <input type="checkbox" name="user_listens_to_anything_we_tell_him" value="yes">
</xmp>
Check Me <input type="checkbox" name="user_listens_to_anything_we_tell_him" value="yes">
<p>We can also use the <b>checked</b> attribute here to make default
   selections.</p>
   <li>Buttons - For submiting or reseting the form</li>
<p>To put a button in our web page we use the input button tags. There two
button types: <b>submit</b>, and <b>reset</b>.
<p>A submit button will take the information in the form and send it
to be processed by the action defined by the form using the method
defined by the form. Without at least a submit button, your form won't
do anything.</p>
<p>A reset button will reset all the values of the fields in your
form.</p>
<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<xmp>
<input type="submit" value="Click Me!">
</xmp>
<input type="submit" value="Click Me!">
</ol>
<p>Let's see a real life example:</p>
<img src="images/hotmail.png" alt="Hotmail's Compose Screen"
border="0" align="center" width="75%">
<p>This page is littered with forms and form elements. The only form
element missing is the Radio Button.</p>

<li>Databases</li>
<ol type="A">
<li>Introduction</li>
<p>What is a <b>Database</b>? According to the official definition, a
database is any organized body of related information. Several
examples might include a dictionary, a telephone book, a shopping
list, etc.</p>
<p>The most prevalent type of database is the relational database, a
tabular database in which data is defined so that it can be
reorganized and accessed in a number of different ways. The relational
database was invented by E. F. Codd at IBM in 1970.</p>
<li>Relational Database Tables</li>
<p>In a relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted
into predefined categories. Each table (which is sometimes called a
relation) contains one or more data categories in columns. Each row
contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the
columns.</p>
<p>For example, a typical business order entry database would
include a table that described a customer with columns for name,
address, phone number, etc. It might look as follows:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>Name</td><td>Address</td><td>Phone Number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yonah Russ</td><td>123 Sesame Street</td><td>01-234-5678</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Another table would describe an order: product, customer, date, sales
price, etc. It might look as follows:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>Product</td><td>Customer</td><td>Date</td><td>Price</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Computer</td><td>Yonah Russ</td><td>10/02/03</td><td>$1000</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>One user of the database could obtain a view of the database that fitted
the user's needs. For example, a branch office manager might like a
view or report on all customers that had bought products after a
certain date. A financial services manager in the same company could,
from the same tables, obtain a report on accounts that needed to be
paid.</p>
<li>Data Modeling</li>
<ol type="1">
<li>Entities</li>
<p>The first step in modeling a service or process, is to identify the
entities involved in that process. An entity is a thing or object of
significance to the business, whether real or imagined, about which
the business must collect and maintain data, or about which
information needs to be known or held. An entity may be a tangible or
real object like a person or a building; it may be an activity like an
appointment or an operation; it may be conceptual as in a an
organizational unit.</p> 
<p>Whatever is chosen as an entity must be described in real terms. It
must be uniquely identifiable. That is, each instance or occurrence of
an entity must be separate and distinctly identifiable from all other
instances of that type of entity.</p>
<p>For example, if we were designing a computerized application for
the care of plants in a greenhouse, one of its processes might be
tracking plant waterings. Within that process, there are two entities:
the Plant entity and the Watering entity. The Plant has
significance. Each Plant is uniquely identified by its biological
name, or some other unique reference to it. A Watering has
significance as an application of water to a plant. Each Watering is
uniquely identified by the date and time of its application.</p>
<li>Attributes</li>
<p>After you identify an entity, then you describe it in real terms, or
through its attributes. An attribute is any detail that serves to
identify, qualify, classify, quantify, or otherwise express the state
of an entity occurrence or a relationship. Attributes are specific
pieces of information which need to be known or held.</p>
<p>An attribute is either required or optional. When it's required, we
must have a value for it, a value must be known for each entity
occurrence. When it's optional, we could have a value for it, a value
may be known for each entity occurrence. For example, some attributes
for Plant are: description, date of acquisition, flowering or
non-flowering, and pot size. The description is required for every
Plant. The pot size is optional since some plants do not come in
pots. Again, some of Watering's attributes are: date and time of
application, amount of water, and water temperature. The date and time
are required for every Watering. The water temperature is optional
since we do not always check it before watering some plants.</p>
<p>The attributes reflect the need for the information they provide. In
the analysis meeting, the participants should list as many attributes
as possible. Later they can weed out those that are not applicable to
the application, or those the client is not prepared to spend the
resources on to collect and maintain. The participants come to an
agreement on which attributes belong with an entity, as well as which
attributes are required or optional.</p>
<p>The attributes which uniquely define an occurrence of an entity are
called primary keys. If such an attribute doesn't exist naturally, a
new attribute is defined for that purpose, for example an ID number or
code.</p>
<li>Relationships</li>
<p>After two or more entities are identified and defined with attributes,
the participants determine if a relationship exists between the
entities. A relationship is any association, linkage, or connection
between the entities of interest to the business; it is a
two-directional, significant association between two entities, or
between an entity and itself. Each relationship has a name, an
optionality (optional or mandatory), and a degree (how many). A
relationship is described in real terms.</p>
<p>Rarely will there be a relationship between every entity and every
other entity in an application. If there are only two or three
entities, then perhaps there will be relationships between them
all. In a larger application, there are not always relationships
between one entity and all of the others.</p>
<p>Assigning a name, an optionality, and a degree to a relationship helps
confirm the validity of that relationship. If you cannot give a
relationship all these things, then perhaps there really is no
relationship at all. For example, there is a relationship between
Plant and Watering. Each Plant may be given one or more
Waterings. Each Watering must be for one and only one specific
Plant.</p>
<li>Entity Relationship Diagrams</li>
<p>A picture is worth 1000 words. We can define a schema for
describing the Entity Relationship model in the form of a diagram.</p>
<p>First let's define the symbols for each part of the model.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>Entities</td><td>Attributes</td><td>Relationships</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="images/entity.gif" border="0"></td>
<td><img src="images/attribute.gif" border="0"></td>
<td><img src="images/relationship.gif" border="0"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Here is an example ER Diagram:</p>
<img src="images/er.gif" border="2">
</ol>
<li>Accessing a Database</li>
<p>Databases are built using the client server structure. A program
that wishes to use a database must implement a client. In our case, we
will use the functions existing in PHP for this purpose. The client
implementation must connect to the database server and perform
<b>queries</b>. A <b>query</b> tells the database server what
information to retrieve and how to report it. A query can also be used
to insert, update, or delete data from the database.</p>
<p>Queries are written using <b>Structured Query Language</b> also
known as <b>SQL</b>. All versions of SQL are basically the same
although each server has its own extensions and syntax which may give
it certain advantages and/or disadvantages.</p>
<p>We will be using the MySQL database server. It is free, fast, and
very well known.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Creating Tables</li>
<p>Everything in the database is stored in tables. The tables are
created using SQL queries. In the creation of a table we define the
name and type of each field(column). We also place <b>constraints</b>
on the fields in order to ensure the validity of the data, ie. a field
for the age of a person could not have a negative number as a
value. Here is the <b>CREATE TABLE</b> syntax:</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE <i>&lt;new table name&gt;</i> (
	fieldname fieldtype (options),
	fieldname2 fieldtype2 (options2),
	...
);
</pre>
<p>Create table creates a new table in the currently connected
database.  <i>new table name</i> may only include alphanumeric
characters and no white space ([A-Za-z0-9_]). For field specifics see
field descriptors later in this file. Let's see an example:</p>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE example_table (
  id int(10) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL auto_increment,
  status tinyint(3),
  username varchar(20),
  email varchar(255),
  description text,
  datecreated datetime,
  lastupdated datetime,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
</pre>
<p>This creates a table called example_table which looks like:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td colspan="7">example_table</td></tr>
<tr><td>id</td><td>status</td><td>username</td><td>email</td><td>description</td><td>datecreated</td><td>lastupdated</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Aside from being able to visualize the table from it's CREATE
command, we also need to understand the field types. Otherwise, we
might try to put illegal data into one of the fields when we write our
program.</p>
<li>Field Types</li>
<p>All fields allow for a "NOT NULL" option, and a DEFAULT value</p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=1>

</table>
<li>Adding Data</li>
<p>Every table in a database represents some relationship. Each row in
a table represents an instance of that relationship. For example,
consider the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td colspan="5">learning_programs</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>program_id</td>
<td>name</td>
<td>description</td>
<td>learning_units</td>
<td>last_run</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Ownership</td>
<td>Show John an object. He must say "sheli" if it's his.</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>Sunday Feb. 16, 2003</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This table describes information relating to a learning program. In
order to add a new learning program to the table I use an
<b>INSERT</b> query. Here is the INSERT syntax:</p>
<pre>
INSERT INTO <i>&lt;table&gt;</i> (<i>&lt;fieldlist&gt;</i>) VALUES (<i>&lt;values&gt;</i>);
</pre>
<p>Enters a new row into <i>&lt;table&gt;</i>. In the case of a
<i>&lt;fieldlist&gt;</i> the values for the given fields and in the
given order are entered. When no field list is specified all fields
must have a supplied value (even if that value is NULL) and values
will be inserted in the order they appear in the table's field list
given by mysqlshow.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If a field is defined as auto_increment then "NULL"
should be passed. Dates and times can be in a number of formats but
the recommended format is: <i>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss</i>. Let's see an example:
<pre>
INSERT INTO learning_programs (program_id,name,description,learning_units,last_run)
VALUES (NULL,'Matching','Put the blocks in the matching holes',15,NOW());
</pre>
<p>This query should result in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td colspan="5">learning_programs</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>program_id</td>
<td>name</td>
<td>description</td>
<td>learning_units</td>
<td>last_run</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Ownership</td>
<td>Show John an object. He must say "sheli" if it's his.</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>Sunday Feb. 16, 2003</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Matching</td>
<td>Put the blocks in the matching holes.</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>'  27 15:15:56 IST 2003
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<li>Deleting Data</li>
<p>Deleting data is also done via SQL queries. Here is the syntax:</p>
<pre>
DELETE FROM <i>&lt;table&gt;</i> ( WHERE <i>&lt;field&gt;</i> <i>&lt;operator&gt;</i> <i>&lt;value&gt;</i>);
</pre>
Deletes rows from <i>&lt;table&gt;</i>. By itself, the <b>DELETE</b>
query will delete all the rows in the table. In order to specify the
rows which are to be deleted we add the <b>WHERE</b> clause. Where
ever the WHERE clause matches a row, the row will be deleted. For example:</p>
<pre>
DELETE FROM learning_programs WHERE program_id = 1;
</pre>
<p>This query should result in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td colspan="5">learning_programs</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>program_id</td>
<td>name</td>
<td>description</td>
<td>learning_units</td>
<td>last_run</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Matching</td>
<td>Put the blocks in the matching holes.</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>'  27 15:15:56 IST 2003
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Note the use of the '=' operator. SQL has several operators which
we must learn. Many of them are the same as in PHP.</p>
<li>Operators</li>
<p>All expressions can be grouped with parentheses ie. (
(user='username') AND (pass='password') )
<table border="1" cellspacing=2 cellpadding=1>
	<tr>
		<td colspan=3><b>Logical Operators</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>AND or &&</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>&nbsp;</td>
		<td width=50%>evaluates to 1 if both sides are true</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>OR or ||</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>&nbsp;</td>
		<td width=50%>evaluates to 1 if either side is true</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>NOT or !</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>&nbsp;</td>
		<td width=50%>evaluates to 1 if following side is false</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan=3><b>Comparison Operators</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>=</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>a = b</td>
		<td width=50%>true if operands are equal</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>!=, <></td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>a != b, a <> b</td>
		<td width=50%>true if operands are not equal</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>< , <=</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>a < b, a <= b</td>
		<td width=50%>true if less than, or if less than or equal to</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>> , >=</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>a > b, a >= b</td>
		<td width=50%>true if greater than, or if greater than or equal to</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>LIKE</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>a LIKE b</td>
		<td width=50%>Pattern Match: true if a matches b</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>NOT LIKE</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>a NOT LIKE b</td>
		<td width=50%>Pattern Match: true if a does not match b</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>IS NULL</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>a IS NULL</td>
		<td width=50%>true if a is NULL</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign=top width=25%>IS NOT NULL</td>
		<td valign=top width=25%>a IS NOT NULL</td>
		<td width=50%>true if a is not NULL</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>When using the <b>Pattern Matching</b> operators, <b>LIKE</b>,
etc. you can use the wildcard '%' to match anything. We will see
examples as we continue.</p>
<li>Updating Data</li>
<p>Don't think you have to delete a row and insert a new one when you
want to change something in the database. Here is the <b>UPDATE</b>
syntax:</p>
<pre>
UPDATE <i>&lt;table&gt;</i> SET <i>&lt;field1&gt;</i>=<i>&lt;value1&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;field2&gt;</i>=<i>&lt;value2&gt;</i>, ... ( WHERE <i>&lt;field&gt;</i> <i>&lt;operator&gt;</i> <i>&lt;value&gt;</i>)
</pre>
<p>Updates all rows in <i>&lt;table&gt;</i> setting each field equal
to its corresponding value in the "SET list" where ever a row matches
the WHERE clause. If no WHERE clause is provided then all rows are
updated. For example:</p>
<pre>
UPDATE learning_programs SET name='Matching Blocks'  WHERE program_id=2;
</pre>
<p>This query should result in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td colspan="5">learning_programs</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>program_id</td>
<td>name</td>
<td>description</td>
<td>learning_units</td>
<td>last_run</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Matching Blocks</td>
<td>Put the blocks in the matching holes.</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>'  27 15:15:56 IST 2003
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<li>Retrieving Data</li>
<p>Retrieves specified fields in the given number of rows (default is
all matching) starting at the given row (default is 0) from
<i>&lt;table&gt;</i> where records match,returned in the specified
order (defaults to database structure, not necessarily input order).</p>
<p>The field list may contain a number of specialized variants
including, *, COUNT(*). The "AS" keyword allows a field name to be
aliased to another, for example: SELECT verylongfieldname AS vlfn
makes the values in "verylongfieldname" appear as values in a field
named "vlfn" instead.</p>
<p>Fields may be selected from multiple tables in the same query, but
may require a field to be related in each table. When selecting from
multiple tables non-unique fields will conflict if the table name is
not included, for example if you are selecting from table1 and table2
and both have an "id" field then the field(s) you are selecting and
the field(s) you are querying will need to be stated completely, such
as table1.id and table2.id.</p>
<pre>
SELECT <i>&lt;field1&gt;</i>(,<i>&lt;field2&gt;</i> AS <i>&lt;newfieldname&gt;</i>) 
FROM <i>&lt;table1&gt;</i>(,<i>&lt;table2&gt;</i>) 
( WHERE <i>&lt;field&gt;</i> <i>&lt;operator&gt;</i> <i>&lt;value&gt;</i> ) 
( ORDER BY <i>&lt;fieldlist&gt;</i> [DESC] ) 
( LIMIT <i>&lt;startrow&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;numrows&gt;</i> )
</pre>
<p>Let's see some examples:</p>
<pre>
SELECT * FROM learning_programs;
SELECT program_id,name,description FROM learning_programs;
SELECT program_id,name,description FROM learning_programs 
       WHERE learning_units>10;
SELECT program_id,name,description FROM learning_programs 
       WHERE learning_units>10 ORDER BY learning_units;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM learning_programs;
SELECT program_id FROM learning_programs WHERE name LIKE 'M%';
SELECT program_id FROM learning_programs WHERE name LIKE 'M%' LIMIT 0,5;
</pre>
<p>Many times you will have to retrieve information from several
tables. Let's see an example:</p>
<pre>
SELECT table1.id AS userid, table2.email AS useremail, 
       table2.lastupdated AS last_login FROM table1,table2 
       WHERE ((table1.id > 10 AND table2.email LIKE '%@%') AND 
              (table1.id = table2.id)) 
       ORDER BY email DESC LIMIT 0,20;
</pre>
</ol>
<li>Using the Database</li>
<p>To use the database server we must first connect to the database
server and select which database to use. Then we can send our
queries to the database and retrieve the results. After processing the
results we must disconnect from the database. To perform all these
tasks, we use PHP functions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MySQL Functions</li>
<p>Connect to the database using <b>mysql_connect</b> or <b>mysql_pconnect</b>.
mysql_pconnect() acts very much like mysql_connect() with two major
differences.</p>
<p>First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a
(persistent) link that's already open with the same host, username and
password. If one is found, an identifier for it will be returned
instead of opening a new connection.</p>
<p>Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when
the execution of the script ends. Instead, the link will remain open
for future use (mysql_close() will not close links established by
mysql_pconnect()- instead they will timeout after remaining idle for a
defined amount of time).</p>
<p>The syntax of both is as follows:</p>
<pre>
$link = mysql_pconnect ( server, username, password );
</pre>
<p>The function returns a handle to the connection which can be used
with other functions.</p>
