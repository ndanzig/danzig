suffragist, founder of the National Women’s Party (NWP) and the World Women’s
Party (WWP) and author of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), is virtually
unknown to the general public.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Historians, too, neglect her, even historians of women, by concentrating
primarily on her suffrage activities and to a lesser extent on her work for the
ERA, ignoring almost completely her <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In this paper, I will
attempt to redress this imbalance and bias by presenting an overview of her
major international feminist and humanitarian work, and I will conclude with a
brief analysis of her political strategy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>As early as 1923, Alva Belmont, a long time NWP member,
frequently its president, announced that it was time to become involved in
international work.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Our subjection is
world-wide,” she said, “and, therefore, our effort to end it should be
world-wide.”1<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul agreed and in 1925
the two of them recruited European feminists to be members of the newly formed
international advisory council of the NWP.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(It should be noted that European women did not have the right to vote
at this time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the council expanded to include women from
Asia,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>South and North America, and
Africa.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The overwhelming majority were,
of course, from the educated classes, lending ammunition to the charge that the
NWP was an elitist organization.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>NWP
had two other sub-divisions under which it did<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>international work:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Committee
for International Action, headed by Doris Stevens, and The International
Relations Committee, headed by Lola Maverick Lloyd.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul, as chair of the international council,
threw herself into the flurry of international activity that took place during
the inter-war period.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not only was there
the famous Versailles Treaty, including as it did the establishment of the League
of Nations, but also the Kellogg- Briand conference which culminated in the
signing of the Peace Pact which outlawed war. As a part of the League, the
International Labor Organization (ILO) and the World Court were established.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Paul believed that women should be heard and represented in
all these organizations and meetings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Elizabeth Selden Rogers wrote of her in the February 7th, 1925 issue
of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Equal Rights, the official party
organ, as follows:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“But all the time
there is another powerful call in Miss Paul’s ears--the masculine-run, masculine
dominated nations of the world, are writing their treaties, leagues and
protocols, and proposing to codify international laws, without it even
occurring to them that women exist, much less that they should share equally
with men in these affairs so vital to women.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Paul based her international strategy on her experience with
suffrage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In that case, she had drafted
what would become the 19th amendment to the Constitution granting women the
right to vote.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this draft, she and
her colleagues wrote an equal rights treaty that they tried to get countries to
ratify.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In these countries women would
have equal legal rights to men.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was
to use this same strategy later in drafting the ERA.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>When it became known that the president of France was hosting
a luncheon for the delegates to the Kellogg-Briand Peace Conference at his
suburban home in Rambouillet, a Parisian suburb, the NWP protested their
exclusion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Doris Stevens had formally
requested an audience with the dignitaries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Her request was turned down, so she decided to confront them
directly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The group stood in front of
the house with a banner that read,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“We
demand a Treaty Giving Women Their Rights.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They were quickly arrested by the French police and according to their
own reports, roughed-up considerably.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Stevens, speaking at a mass meeting of feminists in Paris a few days
later said, “This humble pavement at Rambouillet became the world’s forum.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the world knew the following day about
the Equal Rights Treaty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They told us we
lacked tact.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course we lacked
tact.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are in revolt...and when a
group, a nation, a race, a sex is in revolt, it is not concerned with
tact.”3<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nonetheless, this was the last
time this type of strategy was used by them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>The NWP fought for equal nationality as a part of equal
rights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Women lost their nationality if
they married a foreigner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was true
in the U.S. and elsewhere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Men retained
their nationality regardless of whom they married.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were many sad cases of women becoming
stateless on the death of their foreign husbands or of being refused entry into
their country of origin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The World Court
took up this matter as part of its attempt to codify all laws in 1930 at the
Hague.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unfortunately for women, it
recommended that a woman’s nationality be that of her husband’s, leading
feminists to call this conference the Convention of Abominations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Alice Paul and Lady Rhondda, a prominent
English feminist, organized Equal Rights International (ERI) in response,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“...to ensure representation of the militant
feminist viewpoint at the League.”4<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both
the ERI and the NWP lobbied unsuccessfully against ratification of the
convention and for the Equal Rights Treaty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The League responded by setting up the Women’s Consultative Committee on
Nationality in 1931.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was the first
time in history that an international body of such stature had designated a
committee especially about women. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>During this same time period, the NWP was also working in
Latin America.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Through their efforts the
Fifth Pan-American Conference at Santiago in 1923 voted to include discussion
of women’s rights at their subsequent meeting in Havana in 1928.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>“When the Sixth Conference met, no women
were in the American delegation headed by Charles Evans Hughes: and the
resolution of the Fifth Conference was ignored until the NWP dispatched four
women to Havana.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They demanded a
hearing:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>but the conference politely
refused, saying that women had never spoken before an international congress
and a precedent could not be set now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The women employed well-tested techniques and got their hearing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They focused attention on their demands by
cornering delegates, holding mass rallies, presenting petitions and giving
numerous press interviews.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They got
several delegations to pledge support for an equal rights treaty. Rather then
write such a treaty, the conference unanimously voted to study women’s
conditions and make recommendations to the Seventh Pan-American Conference in
1933 at Montevideo.5<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus the Inter-American
Commission on Women was born and Stevens was its first chairman.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The commission presented the following draft
to the Montevideo Conference:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“The
contracting parties agree that from the going into effect of this treaty, there
shall be no distinction based on sex in their law and practice relating to
nationality.”6<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The treaty was adopted
with the U.S. being the only abstention.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The NWP was horrified and went to work immediately to get President
Roosevelt to change the American vote.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Time Magazine of January 1, 1934 reported,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“The President reversed his orders last week
after a tempest of protest had been blown up in Washington by that pallid
dynamo of political white lightning, Dr. Alice Paul, founder of the NWP!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She mobilized assorted senators,
representatives and even Amelia Earhart who pleaded,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>‘Please help women gain equality in
nationality.’”7<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Inspired by this victory
for nationality at Montevideo, Stevens also proposed the equal rights treaty
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was actually able to get four
signatories: Paraguay, Equador, Uraguay and Cuba.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Paul spent the rest of the 30’s in Europe.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her efforts there were directed toward three
goals:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to work against the ratification
of the Hague Nationality Convention and to gain acceptance by the League of
equal nationality for women;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to get the
League to adopt the Equal Rights Treaty; and to confront the ILO regarding
labor conventions she considered discriminatory against women.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This topic is extremely complex and
controversial, dealing as it does in major part with protective
legislation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is really beyond the
scope of this paper, however, it should be noted that Paul was successful in
getting some of the most pernicious clauses removed from these treaties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>As Paul was trying to promote the cause of women world-wide,
fascism was on the rise trying to push women back to the home and out of the
labor market.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the summer of 1935 she
commented to the Washington Post,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Never
in my life have I seen such discrimination against women; never since the turn
of the century-and even before-have women been more in danger of losing every
right, and of gaining none.”8<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the
situation in Europe worsened, she saw the necessity of starting an American
based international feminist organization which would work for equal rights and
nationality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was afraid that
European feminist organizations might succumb to reactionary movements in their
own countries or that they would not be able to function should there be a
war.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, she wanted an
international organization that she herself could control and which would gain
her access to the Women’s Consultative Committee of the League.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>In October, 1937 she wrote to the council of the NWP
requesting that the NWP be made an international organization,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“...to raise the status of women in the
international field.”9<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The 1938 national
convention of the NWP at Detroit formally endorsed the proposal and the World
Woman’s Party was born.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
incorporated in Washington, D.C. that same year.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its first president was Lady
Pethick-Lawrence, a well known English suffragette and egalitarian
feminist.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul, however, as the
chairman, assumed responsibility for the day to day operations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Party headquarters was officially opened in
a rented villa in Geneva, Switzerland in 1939.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Soon the villa assumed an unpredicted function.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It became home to many feminist refugees from
Germany and Austria.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most were Jewish
and frequently they brought their husbands and children with them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a letter to Amy Ransome, the American
treasurer of the WWP, Paul described the situation as follows:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Our house is full up just now; even the
attic rooms, intended to be storage rooms only, are occupied.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All those living with us have been, in their
own countries, worthy contributors to the women’s movement and we hope it will
be possible for them to go to America.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Their individual fates have been so terrible and their work in our cause
so distinguished, that they are certainly entitled to all the energy we are
able to put into their salvation.”10<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Paul directed a great deal of her energy from ‘39-’41 to
rescuing these people.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were caught
in a bind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Switzerland would not allow
them to stay, the U.S. would not allow them to enter, and if they went back to
their country of origin, they would either be put in concentration camps or
executed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul used her situation, an
office in Geneva and one in Washington, and her connections (which were always
high-up) to the best possible advantage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She wrote literally hundreds of letters, sent scores of cables and
personally visited consular offices and refugee organizations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She found American sponsors who were willing
to assume financial responsibility for people they did not know solely on her
recommendation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was able to save
approximately 75% of the people who requested help.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul not only rescued them, she found them
jobs and housing, and corresponded with them after they arrived, trying to help
them with their adjustment problems.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Through these letters she shows tremendous patience and compassion,
attributes which are not ordinarily ascribed to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>In the spring of 1941 the U.S. entered the war and Paul was
forced to leave Europe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The New York
World Telegram of April 3, 1941 quoted her on arrival in the States as saying,
“This world crisis...came about without women having anything to do with
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the women of the world had not
been excluded from world affairs things today might have been different.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a man-made war.”11<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>The WWP was relatively dormant during the war, but as the
war came to an end, Paul realized that she would have to redouble the effort
she had exerted at the League toward the new international organization which
was on the drawing boards and which the U.S. would join: the U. N..<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul wanted to make sure that women were
represented in all delegations, mentioned in all documents where men were
mentioned, and that the organization would dedicate itself to the establishment
of equal political and civil rights for women.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>The tentative plans for the UNO, as it was called then, were
developed at Dumbarton Oaks between August and October of 1944.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were no women in any of the delegations
except the Chinese, which had one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul
sent Chiang Kai Shek a cable thanking him for this gesture.12<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The proposals from Dumbarton Oaks were sent
to the San Francisco conference held in April, 1945.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here the details of the organization were
hammered out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul wanted women to be
present so that an equality measure would be included in the charter which was
to be written.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She did everything she
could to get consultant status to the U.S. delegation for the WWP.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although she did not succeed in this,
representatives were allowed in some meetings and could, of course, lobby
informally.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Mrs. Jessie Street of
Australia, an official delegate, was also totally in sympathy with WWP goals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So that even though the U.S. and Great
Britain objected, an equality provision was placed in the charter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The WWP reported to its members, “The
Charter, as finally adopted on June 26,1945, reaffirmed, in its Preamble:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>faith in fundamental human rights, in the
dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women,
and contained six other sections declaring against distinctions on the ground

women delegates, introduced a motion that a commission on the status of women
be created.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This motion was taken up at
the first meeting of the General Assembly in London in January of 1946.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again, both the U.S. and Great Britain
objected, claiming that all matters relating to women would be included under
the Human Rights Commission.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Eleanor
Roosevelt, who was the chair of that commission, agreed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nonetheless, as the result of intensive lobbying
a subcommission on the status of women was established under the Human Rights
Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman"'>This subcommission composed of seven women, none from the
U.S., met at Hunter College in May of 1946 and wrote a comprehensive report
covering its aims and programs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Primary
among its aims was universal suffrage and the right to hold office.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also proposed that a survey be taken on
the status of women in the member nations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Other sections dealt with civil, economic and social goals for women.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The report was first presented to the Human
Rights Commission, but Mrs. Roosevelt and the French Commissioner, Rene Cassin
considered the recommendations too ambitious and adopted only one of them,
recommending that most of the report be tabled for further study.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Alice Paul led the fight, therefore, for the
subcommission<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to be raised to a full
commission so that it would report directly to ECOSOC, (The Economic and Social
Council), rather than to Human Rights where it was bound to be treated
unsympathetically.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This motion was
presented to ECOSOC, late in the evening of June 21, when Mrs. Roosevelt was
not present.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The motion passed and the
report was accepted.14<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Paul believed
that Roosevelt presented the major obstacle and, therefore, it was necessary to
go behind her back if any progress were to occur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"Times New Roman"'>The ‘Cause’, as Paul always referred to it, was not so
fortunate at the Paris Peace Conference held in August of 1946.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A delegation from the WWP went to the
conference requesting that women be represented in the various delegations and
that any peace treaty contain equal rights for women.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>On the absence of women Paul said,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Throughout history, no peace conference has
ever included women.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The men who decide
these things say that they do not now have women in the deliberations because
they are not competent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Certainly men
are not competent, for they always end up with war after war when they finish
with peace-making.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>She went on to add,
“...there will continue to be failures and disillusionment until that half of
the population who cares more about peace than war, more about human values
than boundary lines, has an opportunity to have its say.”15<span

was the inclusion of its request in the formal proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Commission on the Status of Women met with failure, Judge Dorothy Kenyon was
appointed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Kenyon, according to Paul
had, “...sat for two years on the League of Nations Committee on the Status of
women and [had done] nothing to raise the status of women.”16<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul’s cause fared better, however, at the
second UN General Assembly session held at Lake Success in December of
1946.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs Bodil Begtrup, the chair of
the commission, a Danish delegate and a staunch ally of Paul’s, proposed a
resolution that, “...all member states which have not done so already, adopt
measures necessary to fulfill the purpose and ends of the Charter...by granting
women the same political rights as men.”17<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This resolution was adopted unanimously, but, “...that portion...which
would have reequested the security council to consider whether women had equal
rights in judging applicants for U.N. membership, was withdrawn on the ground
that it would provoke repetition of a long debate on qualifications for
membership which occurred in the policial committee.”18<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul commented, “The step taken by the
Assembly in calling upon all member nations to establish equal voting rights
for women marks another milestone in the movement to raise the status of women
throughout the world.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is every
reason to believe that all countries belonging to the United Nations will now
bring their suffrage laws up to the standard of equality recommended by the
Assembly.”19<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>More forceful measures
would need to be taken later, although several countries did extend voting
rights to women as a result of this resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>This same assembly decided that a Universal Declaration of
Human Rights similar to our Bill of Rights be developed under the auspices of
the Human Rights Commission.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The task
was submitted to a drafting committee which was chaired by Mrs. Roosevelt, one
of its two women members.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>WWP wrote to
her expressing their hope that, “...equality of the sexes will be included as a
specific provision in all declarations of the committee...”20<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“Mrs. Roosevelt proposed the omission of all questions on women’s
status...” according to a press release put out by the WWP.21<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Hansa Mehta, the other woman on the
committee, was an egalitarian and as a result the committee was unable to come
to an agreement on this issue and the whole matter was referred to another
drafting committee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>WWP members
intensively lobbied this group and won the inclusions they sought in the
draft.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Roosevelt again appeared to
be a crafty opponent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Neither the Charter nor the Declaration of Human Rights was binding,
however.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To overcome this serious defect
a binding Covenant on Human Rights was developed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The struggle over equality clauses in this
document was to last from 1947 to 1966.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Eleanor Roosevelt, according to Paul, opposed explicit mention of sex in
the Covenant because she thought that it, “...should be more general and just
talk about general human rights.”22<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
1951 Paul wrote to Florence Kitchelt, “The Covenant as now written would
probably be interpreted as permitting discriminatory treatment of women.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Covenant should, therefore, be made
clearer than it is now on this subject... It will be difficult to obtain a good
equal rights article...I am afraid, in view of Mrs. Roosevelt’s attitude.” 23<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The draft ran into further trouble because it
not only contained political and civil rights, but also articles on economic,
cultural and social activity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs.
Roosevelt was particularly adamant against the latter, but eventually all
sections were adopted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>The Latin American states, although members of the UN,
continued to maintain their own regional organization, the Pan-American Union
which became the Organization of American States after the war.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, as it had in the past, the WWP
maintained a presence there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1948 the
Ninth International Conference of American States met at Bogota, Amelia Himes
Walker representing the WWP.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
conference adopted a political rights convention that guaranteed women the
right to vote and hold office.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also
adopted a separate civil rights convention which the U.S. refused to sign,
claiming that in their country, these matters were under the jurisdiction of
the individual states and not the federal government.<span

ratified the political rights section and ten, the civil rights part. 24<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Meanwhile, back at the UN the Commission on the Status of
Women met at Lake Success in 1950.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Concerned that women could not vote at all in 16 countries, that in five
they could vote only in local elections, and in three qualifications for voting
were different for men and women, the commission proposed drawing up a treaty
similar to the one adopted at Bogota.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The new treaty went through the rounds of the various UN committees
until its final approval by the General Assembly in 1953.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before the debate on the treaty began,
however, Paul was asked by the U.S. government to prepare a statement on equal
political rights ro be presented by Mrs. Roosevelt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Paul was astonished by this request because
it was the first time in which the US government had ever recognized her
leadership in the fight for women’s rights.” 25<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Although there were 25 signatories to the treaty by the end of 1953, the
US was not among them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

by the WWP in these post-war years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
has been just a sketch of the highlights of their political activity.<span

of her comrades were even older.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During
the fifties, Paul, according to her own testimony, deserted the WWP because of
the threat to the ERA posed by the Hayden Rider. 26<span

1957 was basically defunct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New";mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>In summation, the WWP can be credited with keeping women’s
issues alive on the international scene during a period which has been described
as the ‘doldrums’ for feminism.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Certainly it was responsible for uniting egalitarian women delegates at
the UN.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There can be no doubt that many
women all over the world owe their right to vote and hold office to the efforts
of the WWP.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And yet few people even know

the use of blanket treaties to gain results. She probably over-estimated their
efficacy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, she was not alone
