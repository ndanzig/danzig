<h1>Application </h1>
<ol>

<li> My educational, professional, and Jewish Communal activities: <p>
I am currently studying toward a Masters degree in Machshevet Yisrael
( Jewish Thought ) at Hebrew University.  My concentration is in mediaeval
philosophy and especially the Rambam.  I plan to continue for a Ph.d. in the
coming years.  I also study Talmud several times a week with a study partner.
I teach various subjects at the one year mechina program at Machon Lev given
for English speaking students. I live in Katamon and my main communal activity is
inviting people for sabbath and holiday meals.

<li>What I hope to gain at the Pardes Kollel: <p>
I hope to develop a more varied approach to the study of the Talmud and
other Jewish religious literature. I have studied Talmud at Haredi and moderate
Yeshivot and at Hebrew University and the Hartman Institute.
Each of these places has shown me a different and new way to read the Talmud.
Interestingly, I have found myself very comfortable with each of these different
styles and I feel they each offer something authentic.
I have tried on my own to  integrate these different approaches, but it
would be very valuable for me to grow as an educator and student to see how my
peers have dealt with these at times conflicting approaches.  I hope to meet
with thinking people who are eager to evaluate and develop enlightening
approaches to learning. Also, I just love learning and know that the learning at Pardes
will be very enjoyable and challenging.

<li>How I will enhance the Kollel:
<p>I consider life a constant opportunity to learn and I have tried
my best to absorb a wide variety of information and philosophies.
I continue to study English literature and Jewish history and
both these fields have given me insight into understanding Jewish
texts in their historic contexts.
As I wrote above I have studied Torah in varied frameworks and
from disparate viewpoints.  I have a discerning eye toward
differentiating philosophic approaches and this has helped me to
understand these different points of view. I offer new ideas
and new perspectives on texts which I think would be valuable to the
Beit Midrash.  I have taught Torah for some years and this has
given me patience to hear and appreciation to understand  other people's
ideas.  I think perhaps this is the most important thing that any Beit
Midrash can have, patient listeners and minds eager to see texts
in new ways.  I hope I can offer these.

<li>My favorite text: <p>
It would be hard to pin me down to a specific text.  I find the writings
of Rav Kook moving and insightful (if mostly misunderstood). Who can
compare to Rashi for clarity and brevity?  What is more provocative than the chumash?
But the text that has most affected me and which constantly informs my
life is the Guide of the Perplexed and Rambam in general.  We
seldom realize how greatly he has changed the Jewish mind.  He is responsible
for uprooting the idea of a corporeal G-d. He has taught us that the one thing we
all possess, our minds, is the key to closeness with G-d.  He has ended the dark ages
by teaching us that we must never fear knowledge - that the Torah can never
be at odds with truth. And he has taught us how to find and excise superstition.
His discussion of the rationale for the Law of the Torah can be considered superficial and devoid
of religious emotion, but in fact, it shows that the Torah can be understood as a political
book.  The Laws are designed to create a society ideal for man's perfection.  This means 
that man is the center of the political religion the Torah creates.  In turn, man in this society
is expected to make G-d his focus. This transforms the entire political system of the state into
a holy endeavor.  Man must aim all of his actions, his relation to society, neighbors, and 
himself, toward achieving closeness to G-d.  
This is summed up in one of Maimonides favorite quotes, a quote which
for me expresses the essence of religion, "b'kol drakecha da'eyhu".
