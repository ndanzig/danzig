<h2>Lab Five (5)  Shared Memory and  Semaphores</h2>

<xmp>

Shared memory is system supplied resource which enables 
two or more processes or threads to access the same 
memory space.  It is a valuable method of enabling
Inter Process Communication.


NAME
       shmget - allocates a shared memory segment

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/ipc.h>
       #include <sys/shm.h>
       int shmget(key_t key, int size, int shmflg);

DESCRIPTION
       shmget()  returns the identifier of the shared memory seg-
       ment associated to the value of the argument key.   A  new
       shared  memory segment, with size equal to the round up of
       size to a multiple of PAGE_SIZE, is  created  if  key  has
       value IPC_PRIVATE.


NAME
       shmop - shared memory operations

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/shm.h>
       void *shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);
       int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  shmat  attaches  the shared memory segment identified by
       shmid to the address space  of  the  calling  process.   The  attaching
       address is specified by shmaddr with one of the following criteria:

       If  shmaddr  is NULL, the system chooses a suitable (unused) address at
       which to attach the segment.
       
       A pointer to the memory is returned.  A pointer of -1 indicated failure.


NAME
       shmctl - shared memory control

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/ipc.h>
       #include <sys/shm.h>
       int shmctl(int shmid, int cmd, struct shmid_ds *buf);

DESCRIPTION
       shmctl() allows the user to receive information on a shared memory seg-
       ment, set the owner, group, and permissions of a shared memory segment,
       or  destroy  a segment. The information about the segment identified by
       shmid is returned in a shmid_ds structure:

           struct shmid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm shm_perm;  /* operation perms */
               int shm_segsz;             /* size of segment (bytes) */
               time_t shm_atime;          /* last attach time */
               time_t shm_dtime;          /* last detach time */
               time_t shm_ctime;          /* last change time */
               unsigned short shm_cpid;   /* pid of creator */
               unsigned short shm_lpid;   /* pid of last operator */
               short shm_nattch;          /* no. of current attaches */
	       }	       

      IPC_RMID     is used to mark the segment as destroyed. It will  actually
                   be  destroyed  after  the  last  detach.   (I.e.,  when the
                   shm_nattch member of the associated structure  shmid_ds  is
                   zero.)   The user must be the owner, creator, or the super-
                   user.

Semaphores are a method for locking resources by one process.
This allows for peer level control of system resource passing.
While semaphores are essentially just a global value or flag which is
checked to see if the resource is free (mutexes), in UNIX system 5
they are far more complex and allow a wider range of uses. For example,
sets of semaphores can be created.


NAME
       semget - get a semaphore set identifier

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/ipc.h>
       #include <sys/sem.h>

       int semget(key_t key, int nsems, int semflg);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function returns the semaphore set identifier associated with the
       argument key.  A new set of nsems semaphores is created if key has  the
       value  IPC_PRIVATE.

       The nsems field represents the number of semaphores desired in the set.
       


NAME
       semop - semaphore operations

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/ipc.h>
       #include <sys/sem.h>

       int semop(int semid, struct sembuf *sops, unsigned nsops);

DESCRIPTION
       A semaphore is represented by an anonymous structure including the 
       following members:

           unsigned short  semval;   /* semaphore value */
           unsigned short  semzcnt;  /* # waiting for zero */
           unsigned short  semncnt;  /* # waiting for increase */
           pid_t           sempid;   /* process that did last op */

       The function semop performs  operations  on  selected  members  of  the
       semaphore set  indicated  by semid.  Each of the nsops elements in the
       array pointed to by sops specifies an operation to be  performed  on  a
       semaphore by a struct sembuf including the following members:

sembuf ->  unsigned short sem_num;  /* semaphore number */
           short sem_op;            /* semaphore operation */
           short sem_flg;           /* operation flags */

       Flags  recognized in sem_flg are IPC_NOWAIT and SEM_UNDO.  If an opera-
       tion asserts SEM_UNDO, it will be undone when the process exits.

       The set of operations contained in sops is performed  atomically,  that
       is, the operations are performed at the same time, and only if they can
       all be simultaneously performed.  The behaviour of the system  call  if
       not all operations can be performed immediately depends on the presence
       of the IPC_NOWAIT flag in  the  individual  sem_flg  fields,  as  noted
       below.

       Each  operation  is  performed  on  the  sem_num-th  semaphore  of  the
       semaphore set, where the first semaphore of the  set  is  semaphore  0.
       There  are  three  types  of  operation,  distinguished by the value of
       sem_op.

 -->   If sem_op is a positive integer, the operation adds this value to  the
       semaphore  value  (semval). The calling process must have alter permission
       on the semaphore set.

 -->   If  sem_op is zero, the process must have read access permission on the
       semaphore set.  This is a "wait-for-zero" operation: if semval is zero,
       the  operation  can  immediately  proceed.

 -->   If sem_op is less than zero, the process must have alter permission  on
       the  semaphore set.  If semval is greater than or equal to the absolute
       value of sem_op, the operation can proceed  immediately:  the  absolute
       value of sem_op is subtracted from semval, and, if SEM_UNDO is asserted
       for this operation, the system updates the process undo count  (semadj)
       for  this  semaphore.   If the absolute value of sem_op is greater than
       semval, and IPC_NOWAIT is asserted in sem_flg, the system  call  fails,
       with  errno  set  to EAGAIN (and none of the operations in sops is per-
       formed).  Otherwise semncnt (the counter of processes waiting for  this
       semaphore's value  to  increase) is incremented by one and the process
       sleeps until one of the following occurs:

            1. semval becomes greater than or equal to the  absolute  value  of
	       sem_op,  at  which time the value of semncnt is decremented, the
	       absolute value of sem_op  is  subtracted  from  semval  and,  if
	       SEM_UNDO  is asserted for this operation, the system updates the
	       process undo count (semadj) for this semaphore.
	    2. The semaphore set is removed from the system:  the  system  call
               fails with errno set to EIDRM.
            3. The  calling  process  catches a signal: the value of semncnt is
               decremented and the system call fails with errno set to EINTR.

       On successful completion, the sempid value for each semaphore specified
       in the array pointed to by sops is set to the process ID of the calling
       process.  In addition, the sem_otime is set to the current time.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful the system call returns 0, otherwise it returns  -1  with
       errno indicating the error.


NAME
       semctl - semaphore control operations

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/ipc.h>
       #include <sys/sem.h>
       int semctl(int semid, int semnum, int cmd, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function semctl performs the control operation specified by cmd on
       the semnum-th semaphore of the semaphore set identified by semid.
       (Semaphores are numbered starting at 0.)

       This  function  has  three  or four arguments. When there are four, the
       call is semctl(semid,semnum,cmd,arg); where the fourth argument arg has
       a type union semun defined as follows:

 union semun {
             int val;                  /* value for SETVAL */
             struct semid_ds *buf;     /* buffer for IPC_STAT, IPC_SET */
             unsigned short *array;    /* array for GETALL, SETALL */
                                       /* Linux specific part: */
             struct seminfo *__buf;    /* buffer for IPC_INFO */
             };
	     #endif


       IPC_STAT   Copy  info  from  the semaphore set data structure into the
                  structure pointed to by arg.buf.  The  argument  semnum  is  ignored.
                  The  calling  process  must  have  read access privileges on the
                  semaphore set.

       IPC_SET     Write the values of some members of the semid_ds  structure
                   pointed  to by arg.buf to the semaphore set data structure,
                   updating also its  sem_ctime  member.   Considered  members
                   from  the  user  supplied  struct  semid_ds  pointed  to by
                   arg.buf are

                        sem_perm.uid
                        sem_perm.gidbits */

                   The effective userbID of the calling process must  be  that
                   of  the  superbuser,  or  match the creator or owner of the
                   semaphore set.  The argument semnum is ignored.


       IPC_RMID    Immediately remove the semaphore set and  its  data  structure
		   awakening all waiting processes (with an error return
                   and errno set to EIDRM).   The  effective  userbID  of  the
                   calling  process  must  be that of the superbuser, or match
                   the creator or owner of the semaphore  set.   The  argument
                   semnum is ignored.

       SETALL      Set  semval  for all semaphores of the set using arg.array,
                   updating also the sem_ctime member of the  semid_ds  struc-
	           ture  associated  to the set.  Undo entries are cleared for
		   altered semaphores in all processes.  Processes sleeping on
		   the   wait  queue  are  awakened if some semval becomes 0 or
		   increases.  The argument semnum is  ignored.   The  calling
		   process  must have alter access privileges on the semaphore
		   set.

       SETVAL      Set the value  of  semval  to  arg.val  for  the  semnum-th
                   semaphore of the set, updating also the sem_ctime member of
                   the semid_ds structure associated to the set.  Undo entries
                   cesses sleeping on the wait queue are  awakened  if  semval
                   becomes  0  or  increases.   The  calling process must have
                   alter access privileges on the semaphore set.

process until the other process releases the semaphore.

Exercise:

A. Repeat the father and sons assignment from lab 3 on pipes.  Except, this time
have the sons send messages to the father.  To prevent the father from
getting two different sons' messages at the same time, use a semaphore
to control the sons' writing to the pipe.
Also, use some kind of random waiting method so that the sons will write
at random (and potentially conflicting) times.  The strings that the sons write
should be hard-coded in and can be of your choosing.  However, they should 
indicate which son is writing and which time he is writing (e.g. first time,
second time, ....)

B.  Air Traffic Controllers use software to determine if 
two planes are on a collision course.  If they are, the operator
in the tower will radio the pilots and tell them to change course.
The software that calculates this gets input from a RADAR 
machine (mak"am) which tells the location of the planes
at various times. This information is stored in shared memory.
A semaphore is needed in such cases in order to make sure
that the calculation of one plane's trajectory is based on 
data generated at the same time as the other plane's data.
Only once the RADAR recording process has finished with
shared memory for both planes can the collision calculating 
software access the memory.  Furthermore, as long the collision
calculating process is calculating, the RADAR should not be
allowed to change the shared memory.  

Write a program to simulate this.  Have two processes simulating 
planes.  They will each run 2 for loops with x_counter and y_counter
for the x,y coordinates.  The counters of the 2 planes  will run at 
different rates to simulate different speeds. Plane_1 will write its 
x,y coordinates to shared_memory_1 and plane_2 will write to 
shared_memory_2.

RADAR will read  data from shared_memory_1 and shared_memory_2 when 
it is passed the semaphore and write it to shared_memory_3 then will
release semaphore.  Then Collision software will read shared_memory_3
when he gets the semaphore.  He will then release the semaphore to 
RADAR.

If there is a collision, print "Collision! Radio planes."
This should be run in an infinite loop.
Handle Ctrl-C interrupt.

We can eliminate any reference to time, since our semaphore will
guarantee that the times at which plane 1 and plane 2 are observed are the
same. 

So, collisions can be calculated as follows:

           (Y2(plane1)-Y2(plane2))                (X2(plane1)-X2(plane2))
       ---------------------------      =?=    ---------------------------
       plane1(Y2-Y1)- plane2(Y2-Y1)           plane1(X2-X1)-plane2(X2-X1)

Where Y2(plane1) is plane1's Y coordinate at the second observation 
and plane1(Y2-Y1) is the difference between plane1's second and first observed
Y coordinate.  The other symbols are similarly understood.

Note:  You will need to store 2 sets of x,y coordinates for each plane.


C. Write a simulation of a barber shop.  Assume there is one barber and two 
seats for people to wait their turn.   Use a semaphore to simulate controlling the queue.
New customers should come in at random intervals.
If all the waiting chairs are taken they will not be able to take a seat until one frees up.
Use child processes to simulate the clients and the parent process for the barber.

Take this solution and add to it a semephore to simulate the barber chair.
Clients shoule check if the barber's chair itself is available before waiting in the queue.
Use sem_trywait.
