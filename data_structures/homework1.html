Homework Assignments 2002-2003
</h3>


<ol >
<li>Write a class "teacher" which creates several objects of the class
 "studentlist"
each having the methods to add students, grades , find students and print
their grades.</li>

<li>Write a FIFO (queue) implemented via a linked list. It should handle nodes
containing some comparable data.  It should have methods push and pop.</li>
<li>Write a LIFO (stack) implemented via a linked list. It should have a
maximum  number of elements and it should handle nodes
containing some comparable data.  It should also have methods push and pop.</li>
<li> Write a doubly linked sorted linked list. The nodes should be as above.
Also have methods insert, deleted,  find_node and print_list. </li>
<li> Use the abstract key-word to create a generic FIFO capable of storing
Objects of different types</li>
<li>Write a binary sorted tree capable of sorting generic nodes (as in the
above FIFO) using a method return_comparable_data. </li>
<li>Write a recursive method to find a node in the above binary tree
using (1) postordertraversal (2)preordertraversal and (3) inordertraversal (see exercise 19.23) </li>
<li> write a function to delete a node from the tree (see in book exercise 19.22)</li>
<li>Write your own simple compiler using a stack to store operations(see exercise 19.26 - 19.27)</li>
<li>Write an algorithm for balancing an unbalanced tree.</li>

</ol>
