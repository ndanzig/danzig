<p>
A referenece which is passed to a method is a copy of the reference.
If you run the new command on this copy all you get is 
your new local reference to point to the new instance.
when the method ends, the local copy of the reference is
out of scope and the instance is left with no one pointing to him.
He will then be deleted by the garbage collector.

Therefore you must create the haed of the linked list outside of the 
methods and run the new on a node's next pointer, not on it itself.

Never run new on a local variable, the instance will be lost!
