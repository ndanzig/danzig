Homework Assignments 2005

<ol>
<li>
You should know how to make a dynamicly allocated array.  
Study my <a href="dynamic_array.cpp">example with int arrays</a> thoroughly. Make sure you understand it. Discuss it with others in the class. (Don't worry 
if you don't understand the the functions printf and scanf, just know that
 they are basically like cout and cin.)   Then write the same thing using the
 class <b>box</b> instead.  Make a dynamically allocated array of boxes.  
The class box should look like this:
<br>class box{
<br> int height;   
<br>  int length;
<br>  int width;
<br>  box();
<br>}  
<br> box::box(){
<br>  height=1;
<br>  length=1;
<br>  width=1;
<br>  }

</li>
<li>Modify my program <a href="dynamic_array.cpp">dynamic_array.cpp</a> so that
the user can assign his own values to the array.  Also, allow that after he 
has created his array he can decide to make it bigger by any amount he wants.
(He may do this any number of times so you will need an infite loop.)
To do this, you will have to create a new array of the larger total size and 
then copy the values from the old array into the new and then let him put more
 values into the new array and finally, delete the old array. Remember to hold
onto a pointer to the old array so that you can delete it when you are done
copying its contents into the new array. 
</li>

<li> Do the same as the above with a <b>box</b> class array instead of an int array.
Also, add the method computeVolume to the box class.
</li>

<li>
Create a Linked list of Boxes and provide the following functionality:
<br>addBox (int, int, int, box** Head)
<br>findBoxbyHeight(int H, box* Head) this function should go through the 
list and print out the h,l, and w of the first box it finds with the height
 specifiied.  It should also print out the place in the list where the box is 
located. 
<br>save this for last: deleteBoxbyHeight(int, box** Head) deletes a box from 
anywhere in the list if it has the specified height.

</li>

<li> 
Make a class Student with the following attributes: firstname, lastname, t.z.number, GPA, next.  It should have the methods setGPA, and the overloaded operators &gt; and &lt; .  Create the class StudentLL which is a linked list class containing the attribute head of type Box and an orderedAdd method which will add new students according in ascending order.  Use the  &gt; and &lt; operators to keep the list sorted.
</li>

<li>Create a LIFO class with  push and pop functions. The push function should return 1 on success and -1 on failure. The pop function should
return a pointer to a Student, or a pointer cast of -1 on failure. The 
class should have the attributes: Head, maxSize and currentSize. The LIFO should be composed of nodes which 
are Students. and the Student class constructor should take also a pointer to 
the next node he is supposed to point to.

</li>

<li>
Create an array based FIFO.  Make a fixed sized array of boxes.
Write the push anD pop functions.  Popping from an empty list should return the
 error code -1. Similarly, pushing to a full list should cause the same error.
You must recycle the once freed spaces in the array so that if the max size is 10, you will 
be able to add 8 for example, then remove 4 and still be able to add 6 more boxes to the array
. You will need to write a setBox method to set the
values of the already created boxes.
</li>
<LI>
Write a binary tree class which  has the addnode and deletenode functions.  Also include
a printTreeInOrder function which should print all the nodes of the tree in ascending order 
according to whatever greater than / less than  evaluation you choose.
</li>
<li>
Write a linked list of nodes which is capable of containing various classes.  All the classes
should inherit from one class ( say , Employee ) and the linked list 
should be implemented in terms of that parent class. Each child class should have its own
version of a print function.  The linked list class should have a printallnodes member
 function which should print all the nodes of the linked list.  Be sure to use virtual 
functions so that pointers of type parent can be used to call child versions of the print 
function.  Include a delete node and add node function in the linked list class.

</LI>

<li>
Write a quicksort function which can sort an array of integers.

</li>

<li> <i>( Make a student database . Have two classes , student and teacher.  Allow 
a teacher to add students freely  while the program is running. (program should be in an infinite loop) . Use dynamic memory allocation to keep the database 
the exact right size.  Student class should have attributes: name, classestaking
grades.
Teacher has name, classesteaching and password.
Student can register to courses and can check their grades and average.  they cannot change their grades.
Teachers can give themselves courses and can change (or give) grades to students whom they teach.  They can also see the grades of their students. Make appropriate 
methods.
)</i>
