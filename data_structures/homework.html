<h3>
Final Project 2006
</h3>

<p>
Make a class called Node.  Have it inherit to two classes, one called
student and one called teacher.  Create a binary tree class called 
Generic_Tree. It should be able to contain Nodes   ( which in turn are actually
teachers or students.) Node will <b> not </b> be pure virtual, hence it will
 have a contructor. 

<pre>
  
Here is a list of the functionality the classes should support.

Node:
char* toString()
char* getType()
     operators:  >, <, ==, =, <<

Teacher and Student must have their own versions of these functions
and operator overloads reflecting their attributes.

Student will also have the function 
setAverage(float )
float getAverage()

Generic_Tree:

bool addNode( node &)
Node* findNode(char *)
bool deleteNode (Node*)  - must handle head deletion
float getTotalStudentAverage() - computes combined average of all students in tree
printTreeAscending()  - recursive
printTreeDescending()  - recursive
printTreeTopDown()  - recursive


Here is a list of the attributes each class must have (you can add more)

Node:
char* type  -  <b>not</b> char type[20]
Node *right
Node *left 

Tree:
Node * head

Teacher will also have:
float monthlySalary
char* firstName 
char* lastName
char* educationalLevel
char* subject 

Student will also have:
float gradeAverage
char* firstName 
char* lastName
char* gradeLevel
