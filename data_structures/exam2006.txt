1.  What is the advantage of using a red/black tree over using an ordinary 
binary tree ?









2. Write 2 versions of the delete_node function for a binary tree (a tree where
the left node is less than the parent node and the right node is greater than it)
The first version shoud re-insert the children of the deleted node. (no need to 
write insert_node) The second version should connect the children of the 
deleted node in their correct locations.




3. Write the insert_node function for a doubly-linked (previous and next pointers)
sorted list.




4. The heap condition is that the key in each node should be larger than 
(or equal to) the keys in its children (if it has any). Write the insert_
node function for a binary tree implementation of a heap (you must
also write the upheap function to ensure  the heap condition
remains true.)
