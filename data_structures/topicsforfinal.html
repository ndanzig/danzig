<h4>C++ Workshop</h4>
<ul>
<li>Given a class to store a Mixed Fraction, over the +,=,-,==,&lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, /, * , ++ , --, &gt; , &lt; , &gt;= operators for two mixed fractions, for a mixed fraction and an int, and for an int and a mixed fraction, where applicable.


<li>write a template for a  quicksort function so that I can sort any type
of array
<li>Write a multiply function that checks the size of the multiplicand and the 
multiplier (the integer parameters)  and throws an exception if the predicted result will be too large to hold in an int
<li>create a class that can only be instantiated once.  Any attempt to create more than once instance will throw and exception.

<li> Create a base class and a derived class such that a base class pointer to
 a derived class object will call the "print" function in the derived class.

<li>create a class that cannot be instatiated but which has a function 
 that prints "hello world".  Call this function in the main function. 
<li> create a memory leak of 400 bytes.
<li>write a copy constuctor for the class student . Student has the
 following attributes:
1. char * name;  2. int IDNumber; 3. float GPA;

<br>function) How can you in old style C still effectively return other information?
<li>How does C++ address this same issue?
<li>Why must you use the reference parameter when defining a copy constructor?
<li>What is the difference between the implementation of the assignment operator 
and the copy constructor, assuming you write both for you class?

 run the parent function, the child function , or the grandchild function? Explain.
<li>What is the difference between a deep and a shallow copy? Why is this significant?
<li>Why is exception handling better than returning a special value to indicate failure? (two reasons)
