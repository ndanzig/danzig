25 points  (Answer 5  out of 6 questions.  If you answer all 6,
 I will ignore the last question.)
------------------------------


1.  What is a sentinel value? How does it assist in creating a bounded array?


2.  What is the worst case scenario for a binary search tree? Explain. 


3.  What is a balanced tree? If what situations would it be advantagous to a regular BST? What 
are its drawbacks?


4. When do 2-3-4 trees increase their number of rows? 


5. What is the inherent difficulty in implementing a Fifo Array versus a Lifo Array?


6. What is the rule of least access (least privilege)? 




25 points each  (Answer 3 out of 4. If you answer all 4,
 I will ignore the last question.)
 
1.Use an array of 10 nodes to implement a fifo.  Do not use pointers or 
pointer arithmetic.  Write only the class definition for node and fifo.  
Write the push and pop functions for your fifo. If you try to push an 
eleventh element push should fail and throw an exceptionrn.  If you pop 
from an empty list pop should fail and throw an exception. Obviously, 
if you push 10 nodes and then pop some off, you should still be able 
to push more nodes.






2.Write a function to print in descending order an array form Heap in descending order 
( Greatest to Smallest).  It should be an integer heap. Assume that the 
functions push and pop already exist. Assume the limit of the size of the
heap to be 10,000 elements. When your function completes (returns), the 
heap should be as it was before the function call.  The function should
not corrupt the heap in any way.

 




3. Write the delete_node function for a sorted linked-list (sorted in 
ascending order). Be sure to correctly assign the next pointer.  Also 
write the class definition (without the function definitions) for 
class node and a clas linked-list.





4. Write a function to implement a "quicksort" on an array of 
integers.




-------------------------------------------------

Bonus question (5 points):  Explain how using inheritance and virtual functions
one can create a single link-list of objects of differing types (differing classes).
