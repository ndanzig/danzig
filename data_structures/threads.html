<p>
When a program is executing ( or running ) it is called a process.  Every 
process  runs in sequential order.  That means that one command is 
executed after the other.  
However, sometimes we may want to have two alternate lines of execution.
For example, we may want to download a movie, and simultaneously play it.
Normally we would have to wait for the download to finish before we could 
attempt any other command , like playing it.  In such cases we can use
a special Java Class called a Thread.
<p>

We can create an object of type thread in our main( ) method.  This object
has a built in method called run( ) which like the main method is the entry 
point of code execution.  That means that if for example we create two threads,
then we have two points of code execution (in addition to the code exectuting 
in the  main( ) method ) from which we can run any commands we desire.
These commands will be run simultaneously.
<p> Lets see an example:

<pre>
<tt>
file: MyThreadProgram
public class MyThreadProgram{
public static void main( )
   {
      //declare the threads
      MyThread thread1 = new MyThread( "thread1" );
      MyThread thread2 = new MyThread( "thread2" );

      thread1.start();//actually start the threads running 
      thread2.start(); 

        
      System.err.println( "Started two Threads, main ends\n" );
      //System.exit(0) ; this will kill the parent process and the two thread
      //children, therefore not use System.exit(0) in the parent process.
   } // end main()
    
}//end class 


file: MyThread

class MyThread extends Thread{
   private int time;
    
   public MyThread (String name)
   {
      super( name );//call superclass constructor to assign name
      //initialize time
      time = ( int ) ( Math.random() * 8000 );//time will be 0-8000 miliseconds
   }        
    
   public void run()//this is like main( ) in the parent class 
   {
      try {
         System.err.println( 
            getName() + " is going to sleep for " + time + "miliseconds" );
            
         Thread.sleep( time );
      }
        
      // if thread is interrupted during its sleep, print stack trace
      catch ( InterruptedException exception ) {
         exception.printStackTrace();
      }
      System.err.println( getName() + " finished sleeping" );
    
   }
} 

</tt>
</pre> 

<p>
Both threads will execute the code as defined in the file: MyThread.
Both threads will start sleeping at (almost) the exact same moment.
Their sleeping will be done in parallel.
We don't know which thread will finish first since each thread sleeps
a different amount of time.

<p>
A note about the concept of simultaneous execution.  In reality,
if my computer has only one CPU then I cannot execute two seperate commans at
once.  So what is really going in the computer is that the operating system
is creating tiny slices of time, or time slices , of about 5 miliseconds
and giving one slice to each process alternatively.  In this way both
processes will advance together, although not strictly simultaneously, although
from our perspective it will appear to be simultaneous.  In this way we can 
avoid what is called blocking.  Blocking is when one activity cannot be done
because another activity is taking up all the CPU time.  By alternating
the time each process gets the CPU's time we can ensure that all processes get
a share and no process is blocked out. When we create several threads in one
program, the Java compiler asks the operating system to implement a time 
sharing scheme to simulate parallel processing.  True parallel processing 
can only occur on machine with more than one CPU.

<p>
In the above example, both threads executed the same code.  Alternatively, we
 could have totally different executions for the two threads.
We could use an if structure to perform different operations in
each thread.  Here is how:

<pre>
<tt>
file: MyThread

class MyThread extends Thread{
    
   public MyThread (String name)
   {
      super( name );//call superclass constructor to assign name
   }        
    
   public void run()
   {
      try {
         String name=getName();
	 if ( name.equals("thread1") )
             {
	     for (int c=0;c<50;c++)
	             {
	     	     System.err.println("I am thread 1." );
                     }	     
	     }	 
	 else
             {
	     System.err.println("I am thread 2." );
	     }
      }
      // if thread is interrupted during its sleep, print stack trace
      catch ( InterruptedException exception ) {
         exception.printStackTrace();
      }
    
   }
} 

</tt>
</pre> 

<p>
Assume the file: MyThreadProgram is running this thread program.
<p>
Threads can be passed parameters when they are instantiated.  These parameters
follow the normal rules of parameters in methods: if a primitive data type
is passed, it is passed by reference, if an array of a class is passed, it
is passed by reference.  This means that if we give two different threads the
same object, if one thread changes that object, the other thread will
see these changes.  This is called a shared resource.  It is useful in many
types of applications which require inter-process communication.
<p>

A consumer/producer problem is one in which one process creates data or 
information and another process consumes or uses (reads) that data.
A real world example of a consumer/producer problem would be a zoo keeper
and a gorilla.  The zoo keeper supplies bananas and the gorilla eats them.
They have a shared resource, the feeding trough.   
There can be theoretical
problems in such a relationship.  The gorilla might come for food before it
is served and get angry.  The zoo keeper might put out bananas when the gorilla
is not there.  And more problematically, the zoo keeper might put bananas in 
the trough when the gorilla is trying to eat.  That could cost the zoo keeper
his hand!  <p>
When there is a single resource for two process we need to 
synchronize the use of this resource so that only one process acesses 
it at a time.
Otherwise one process could overwrite the work of the other.  The solution
for this problem is to use what is called a semaphore.  A semaphore is
a flag to indicate that the resource is in use.  Before a process accesses
the resource he checks that the flag is not up.  Then when he accesses the
 resource he raises the flag, when he leaves he lowers the flag.  This system
will prevent access overlap.  In java this is called synchronization. 
The following is a simplistic implementation of a  consumer/producer 
problem which does
not deal with the problem of synchronizing acess to the shared resource.

file: Buffer.java
// Buffer interface specifies methods called by Producer and Consumer.

public interface Buffer {
   public void set( int value );  // place value into Buffer
   public int get();              // return value from Buffer
}

file: UnsynchronizedBuffer.java
// UnsynchronizedBuffer represents a single shared integer.

public class UnsynchronizedBuffer implements Buffer {
   private int buffer = -1; // shared by producer and consumer threads

   // place value into buffer
   public void set( int value )
   {
      System.err.println( Thread.currentThread().getName() +
         " writes " + value );

      buffer = value;
   }

   // return value from buffer
   public int get()
   {
      System.err.println( Thread.currentThread().getName() +
         " reads " + buffer );

      return buffer; 
   }

} // end class UnsynchronizedBuffer



file: Producer.java

   {
       super( "Producer" );
       sharedLocation = shared;
   }

   // store values from 1 to 4 in sharedLocation
   public void run()
   {
      for ( int count = 1; count <= 4; count++ ) {  
         
         // sleep 0 to 3 seconds, then place value in Buffer
         try {
            Thread.sleep( ( int ) ( Math.random() * 3001 ) );
            sharedLocation.set( count );  
         }

         // if sleeping thread interrupted, print stack trace
         catch ( InterruptedException exception ) {
            exception.printStackTrace();
         }

      } // end for

      System.err.println( getName() + " done producing." + 
         "\nTerminating " + getName() + ".");

   } // end method run

} // end class Producer



file: Consumer.java

// Consumer's run method controls a thread that loops four
// times and reads a value from sharedLocation each time.

public class Consumer extends Thread { 
   private Buffer sharedLocation; // reference to shared object

   // constructor
   public Consumer( Buffer shared )
   {
      super( "Consumer" );
      sharedLocation = shared;
   }

   // read sharedLocation's value four times and sum the values
   public void run()
   {
      int sum = 0;

      for ( int count = 1; count <= 4; count++ ) {
         
         // sleep 0 to 3 seconds, read value from Buffer and add to sum
         try {
            Thread.sleep( ( int ) ( Math.random() * 3001 ) );    
            sum += sharedLocation.get();
         }

         // if sleeping thread interrupted, print stack trace
         catch ( InterruptedException exception ) {
            exception.printStackTrace();
         }
      }

      System.err.println( getName() + " read values totaling: " + sum + 
         ".\nTerminating " + getName() + ".");

   } // end method run

} // end class Consumer


file: SharedBufferTest.java
// SharedBufferTest creates mrPeebles and consumer threads.

public class SharedBufferTest {

    public static void main( String [] args )
    {
        // create shared object used by threads
        Buffer sharedLocation = new UnsynchronizedBuffer();

        // create producer and consumer objects
        Producer mrPeebles = new Producer( sharedLocation );
        Consumer magilla = new Consumer( sharedLocation );

        mrPeebles.start();  // start producer thread
        magilla.start();  // start consumer thread

    } // end main
