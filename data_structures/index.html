<p>
Data Structures - Object Oriented Data Structures is a first year
second semester computer science 
course that gives the students knowledge of the  basic concepts of Object Oriented Design and 
the design and implementation of basic data structures such as queues, stacks, linked-lists, sorted 
linked-lists, and trees.   
More advanced data structures are also taught such as priority queues, heaps (both linked list 
implementations and array implementations) and balanced ("red-black") trees. Students are 
shown a variety of implementations for each of the above structures.
As these data stuctures are taught, various concepts of Object Oriented Design
are introduced such as
inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and the concept of code re-use.
An emphasis is also place on implementing the above data structures using
abstract data types.   More advanced topics included in the course material 
are listed: approaches to implementing algorithms, analyzing efficiency of algorithms,
advanced recursion, advanced sorting algorithms, and the fundamentals of 
multi-threading (in years when Java is used).
There is an extensive accompanying lab which includes many serious 
projects and utilizes all subjects covered with practical examples.
