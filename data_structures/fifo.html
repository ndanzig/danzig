<h2>Trees</h2>
<p>there are three ways to remove a node from a tree:
<ol>
<li>After removing the node connect his parent to his greater
node and then connect his lesser node to his greaters least least...
<li>after removing the node, connect his parent to his greater node
and then use the insertNode function to re-insert the lesser child.
once the lesser child has been inserted his children will still be
 connected to the tree.  This is simpler to code but will cause more
leaf nodes to be formed.

<li> after the node is removed, insert the node's greater , least least ...
node in its place.  Then connect the least pointer of parent of
 the greater least least ... to the greater child of the promoted node 
(if there is one)


</ol>
