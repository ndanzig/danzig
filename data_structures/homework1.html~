<ol>
<li> Do problem Homework assignment 12 in chapter 20. (i.e. 20.12)
You are asked to convert algebraic expressions like (3+4) * 8 + 9
into post fix notation where the operator follows the second number 
instead of being in between the two numbers.  In the new version
there should be no parantheses and the computer will simply
do each operation as it encounters it.  This means you will have to
put each operator in the right place. For example note this example:
(3+4) * 8 + 9/12.  If we would convert it to 3 4 + 8 * 9 + 12 /
when the computer calculated this it would get the wrong answer.
the correct conversion of this list is: 3 4 + 8 * 9 12 / +.
This will produce the correct answer.  You will need to store numbers and
operators in a stack.  Read teh explanation in the book carefully.
