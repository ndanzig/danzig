<h2>Show your support for land of Israel, and explore the religious traditions of the Children of Israel.</h2>

<p>Revelations, a ten-day seminar on Israel and Judaism, designed specifically for English-speaking Christian
supporters of Israel invites you to join us in Israel this summer.  Discover the spirituality of the religious
communities of modern Israel, gain deeper understanding of the dilemmas and challenges that the people of Israel
face today, and show your support for the miraculous ingathering of the Jewish people to their homeland.
</p>
<br>
<p> The
seminar will include visits to ancient Biblical sites, meetings with leading Israeli political and religious
figures, and insights into the ancient and modern traditions of the Jewish people.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The seminar is run in conjunction with Bar Ilan University, Israel's religious University, and will be held in one
of Jerusalem's five star hotels. Opportunities for touring will be available both during and after the ten-day
program.
