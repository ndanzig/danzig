A ten-day seminar on Israel and Judaism, designed specifically for English-speaking Christian supporters of Israel, invites you to join us in Israel this summer. 
Discover the spirituality of the religious communities of modern Israel. 
Gain deeper understanding of the dilemmas and challenges that the people of Israel face today, and show your support for the miraculous ingathering of the Jewish people to their homeland.
The seminar will include visits to ancient Biblical sites, meetings with leading Israeli political and religious figures, and insights into the ancient and modern traditions of the Jewish people.
