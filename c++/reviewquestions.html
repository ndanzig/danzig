<ol>
<li>Write an array of 10 int pointers and allow the user to create 10 int arrays of sizes
he decides (use the <b>new</b> operator). Point to these arrays with the first array you created.
Allow the use to change the content of each int array in the location he chooses.  If he tries to access
a space beyond the end of any of the arrays don't let him.

<li>
Write a function which is passed a string and which prints out every other character, starting with the second
character.  Do not print past the end of the string.  Use pointer style notation, not array style.
