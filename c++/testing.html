<h2>Introduction to Computer Science - C++</h2>
</center>
<p> Introduction to Computer Science - C++ is a first year computer
science course designed to teach the basic concepts of computer science
and Object Oriented Programming. A basic explanation of how a computer
is built and runs is given. Details of the syntax
of the C++ programming language including all keywords and operators
are taught. Built-in strings manipulation functions
explained and re-implemented. The course also covers the fundamentals
of structured programming, functional programming, and object oriented
programming design. Reading and writing to files is taught.
Operator overloading, function overloading,
and template classes are also taught and their benefits explored.
Different class relationships are covered, including inheritance and
composition. Class
diagramming and software design are introduced. Method writing, sorting
algorithms and recursion are strongly empasized. There is an extensive
accompanying lab which includes many serious projects and utilizes all
subjects covered with practical examples. </p>

<h4>Quotes about software writing </h4>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "If it was hard to write, it should be hard
to read." - well known, and not a good idea
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Seldom is your first idea a solution that
works." -N.D.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Seldom is the solution that works the best
solution." -N.D.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the
code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; as cleverly as possible, you are,
by definition, not smart enough to debug it." - Brian W. Kernighan
