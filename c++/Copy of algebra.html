<H3>Mathematical Operations</H3>

<p> In the beginning computers were basically just large calculators.
And even today, that is basically what they are.  They do thousands of
calculations a second.  Because of this, the most basic part of
any programming language is a set of mathematical operation.
We have already seen some, like addition +.
<p>
Let me list the basic algebraic operators:
<ul>
<li> +&nbsp; add two values
<li> -&nbsp; subtract two values
<li> /&nbsp; divide two values
<li> *&nbsp; multiply two values
<li> %&nbsp; find the remainder after dividing the two values (called modulo or modulus 
)</ul>
<p>
Let me show you some examples:<br>
Assume I have the <b>int a</b>, then <br>
<pre>
a = 7 + 8;  // a is 15
a = 10 - 8;  // a is 2
a = 7 * 8;  // a is 56
a = 16 / 8;  // a is 2
a = 35 / 8;  // a is 4 (because <b>a</b> is an <b>int</b>, C++ rounds a down to the nearest integer, we lose the decimal)
a = 19 % 8;  // a is 3 ( 19 / 8 is 2 remainder 3, using the % gives us the remainder) 
</pre>


<p>
There are also bitwise operators.  What these operators do is manipulate the 
bits of a variable or perform logical operations on values.
Let me list the basic bitwise operators:
<ul>
 <li> & - bitwise and
 <li> | - bitwise or
 <li> ^ - bitwise exclusive or
 <li> &lt; $lt; - left shift
<li> &gt; &gt; - right shift operator

</ul>
<p> To understand this we need to remember that every char, int, float etc. is 
actually a set of bits and bytes.  For instance, a char is 8 bits or one byte.
Usually, and int is 32 bits or 4 bytes.  We can actually change variables
on the level of their bits.  For example,
assume I have the int a, then <br>
<pre>
a = 9 & 8; // a is 8

Why is this?  Well, in reality 8 in bits looks like this
0000 1000
and 9 looks like this:
0000 1001

So, the above operation looks like this:
  0000 1000
& 0000 1001
-------------
  0000 1000

What we are saying with the & operator is look for any place in the 2 sets of
bits that are <b>both</b> 1 and mark that place 1 in the final answer.

Similarly, 
a = 19 | 5; a is 23  

Becasue 19 is 0001 0011 and 5 is 0000 0101

So what we actually wrote is:

  0001 0011
| 0000 0101
--------------
  0001 0111

How did we get to this result? Well, | is logical or, so we look
for any place in the 2 sets of bits where either one or both bits are 1
and then place a 1 in the result.
 
</pre>

<p> Another thing to remember is that operations follow math's rules of 
precedence or <i>Order of Operations</i>.  Thus multiplication occurs before 
addition for example.  We can over-ride the order of operations by using
paranthesis ().  So for example,
<br>
a = 2 + 12 * 5  ; //a is 62
<br>But
<br>
a = (2 + 12) * 5 ; //a is 70
