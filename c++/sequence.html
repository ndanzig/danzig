<p>
What is programming? One answer is, Getting a computer to do stuff.  
That is true and we will learn how to get a computer to perform tasks, 
make calculations, and do stuff.  But programming could also be defined as 
training our minds to think logically, 
orderly and sequentially.  We need to learn to make explicit
want we understand intuitively. 
For example, we may intuitively know what an even number is, we can give
examples of one, but we must discover an explicit, 
exact test to determine whether
a number is even or not.


<p> 
When people first start to use  computers  they sometimes begin to feel that 
the computer has a mind of its own.  They click something expecting one result
and get another. Why is this?  The first thing we have to know is that
behind all the behavior of a computer
lie programming instructions.  And those instructions were written by people.
So in fact, a human being decided that the click you made should cause the 
result it does.  The computer does not have a mind of its own; it is only as 
smart as the person who programmed it.

<p> Actually if a computer were a person, it would be a very dumb person 
indeed.  For example, most people would understand a request like "Please 
put the book on the table." In fact if someone did not understand this, it 
would  surely be cause for concern. But just try to tell a computer  to put a book on a table.  It would have no idea what you mean. (And even if it did, it 
doesn't have a way to move books around!)
To tell a computer something as simple as this, you would first have to explain
what a book is and what a table is.  And then you would have to tell
it how to lift the book, how high to lift it, where to move it in relation
to the table and exactly where on the table to release it.
As you can see, what I am describing is truly a very detailed set of
 instructions. These instructions could be considered a computer program.
Standard computer languages are designed to tell a computer minutely detailed 
instruction for how to complete certain tasks.  These tasks usually center 
around mathematical computations and displaying information on a computer screen  (not moving books onto tables). In this course, we will be using a computer
 language to make our computer do all sorts of fun and exciting things 
(well, some of them are not that exciting.)

<p>

A computer program is a set of <t>instructions</t> that 
a computer can execute (carry out) one after the other.  
Each of these instructions is very simple.    By simple I mean that
it is a very small (discrete) action for the computer to do.  
By combining tens, hundreds or even millions of such instructions
programmers can get computers to do very complex things,  like 
simulating chemical reactions and computing the orbits of twin stars.
They can also do more mundane and simple things like
 computing the salaries of employees and  balancing financial information.


But each instruction on its own does very little. 
Only by combining many instructions can complex actions be done.  
A set of such instructions is called a program.   These
instructions are also called the program <b>code</b>.  
These instructions are executed in order (one after the other
going downward).  Another way of saying "in order" is saying 
"in sequence" 
 Therefore we can say <b>a program is a set of code which is executed in sequence</b>. 
 
</p>

<p>  Unlike 
human beings, computers cannot figure out anything by themselves.  
This means the programmer must spell out every detail of what
he or she wants the computer to do.   A computer can't read 
anyone's mind. Expressing this idea, someone once quipped: 
 <b> A computer doesn't do what you want it to do, it does what 
you tell it to do </b>.    Therefore, be very careful what 
you <b>tell </b>it to do.   
 A computer program could be compared to a cooking recipe for people
 who have no idea how to cook.  
A normal human recipe might have a statement like:

<blockquote>mix the ingredients in a bowl</blockquote>
<br>
A cooking recipe that a computer could understand would be a lot more
detailed.  For the same human instruction above, a computer would need 
something like the following: 
<br><br>
<blockquote>
a bowl is a round container <br>
a cabinet is a shelf with doors <br>
a counter is a flat area 3 feet higher than the ground  <br>
remove bowl from cabinet <br>
put bowl on counter <br>
put each ingredient in bowl   <br>
remove mixing spoon from drawer <br>
stir contents of bowl with mixing spoon 10 times <br>

</blockquote>
<br>

 Since the computer knows very little itself, 
we have to tell it everything we want it to do.
We cannot assume it will figure anything out for itself. 
We have to define all the objects the computer is going to use (the bowl, the
 spoon etc.).  We also have to tell it where to get these instruments from ("remove bowl from cabinet").
We have to tell it how to move one object in relation to another ( "put each
ingredient in bowl")
We have to tell the computer  how many times to mix, etc.  
So you see, on its own , the computer knows very little.  All it really
knows is the language for you to communicate with it.  If it would not even know
a language, you would really have a tough time instructing it what to do.
For our purposes, the language the computer knows is C++.

<p>The objects the  computer uses are kept in the computer's
memory.  Computer memory is also called RAM ( Random
Access Memory).  All your programs are stored in the computer memory (RAM).
When the computer is turned off or restarted the memory (RAM) gets 
swept clean.  The harddrive of your computer works differently.
Information stored there remains even after you turn the computer off.
You could think of RAM as short term memory and harddrive space as
long term memory.
<p>
The RAM of the computer is made up of thousands of blocks of memory.
This memory is used by all the programs running on the computer.
If you are running a program like Microsoft Office, then this program
is using some of the blocks of memory.  Each program gets assigned some 
blocks of memory for its use.  One program should normally
stay away from the memory assigned to another program.
<p>
I like to think of these blocks of memory in the computer RAM as being like a
 warehouse  full of empty shoeboxes inside the computer. The shoeboxes are 
simple brown cardboard boxes
without any labels.  There are thousands of them.  Each program gets assigned 
a few thousand for its use. When a program needs some computer memory, it 
takes down 
5 or 6 boxes and labels them and starts to put things into them.
These boxes are the objects the program will use. They are like for example
the mixing bowl in the "recipe" above.
 Sometimes the program needs to open a shoebox and see what is inside.  Sometimes
 it needs to discard what is in a certain shoebox and
put something else into it. In  C++ (and for that matter, in all programming 
languages that I know) these shoeboxes are called <i><b>variables</b></i>.
In other words, a variable is a place in
the computer's memory (RAM)
where information can be stored.  

<p> 
All variables must have names.  We can't use a variable if it has not been
 named.
  The names we give to our variables are called <b>identifiers</b> 
because they identify
the place in memory where the variable is located.
 The identifier is  usually a few letters long or it may be  a
 short word.  Just as I can reuse the same shoebox many times for
many different shoes, each time removing the old shoes and replacing them with 
a different pair, so too I can reuse the same variable to receive different 
values sequentially.     Because they can receive different values, 
and therefore change in value from time to time, they are called  variables.   
( The value of a variable varies.   It is therefore logical to
say that its value is variable.    Hence, it is called a "variable") 

<p> The steps needed for creating a variable are the following:
(1) have the computer take one block of memory aside, (2) give it
a name, (3) put  data into the memory.  Now this named block of 
memory  (our variable) can be used and reused.

<p>

Now I will demonstrate these steps in  some simple C++ 
instructions that a computer could
 understand.
If the programmer (that's me) wants to compute the sum of 7 and 8 in C++
he  would first need to create a <i>variable</i> to store the sum in.
In the next
instruction he could  put the sum into that variable.  


<p>
  To do the above in C++, I would write  the following:
<blockquote>
int mySum;
<br>mySum = 7+8;
</blockquote>

<p>
Now let's explain this code segment.
  
The above two lines are two instructions which make the variable<i> mySum</i> 
contain the number 15.
What makes it two separate instructions?    
The semi-colon (<b>;</b>) indicates the 
end of each instruction.    By having two semi-colons I indicate that 
I have two instructions ( also called commands ).  
The fact that they are on two separate lines in not relevant.  
I could have two commands on one line, or one command over
two lines (not recommended).    The computer does not 
care about lines.    Human readers do
care about lines.    Human readers find it easier to read 
separate lines,
so programmers usually write each command on a separte line for clarity.
But the computer only cares about semi-colons to separate commands.
  

<p> The first instruction ( command ) is: 

<br>
int mySum;
<p>
When the computer reads this line it needs to create a variable
and to give it the name "mySum" 
 (Remember, a variable is a place in computer memory, 
like a shoebox in our comparison). How does it do this?
First it looks for some unused memory in the block 
of memory that has been assigned to it.  When it finds this unused memory,
it labels it with the name mySum. This is as if a person went into the
storehouse of shoeboxes and took down an empty one and labeled it on the
 outside with a magic marker.

<p>
The word <b>int</b> is a special word in C++
 which indicates that (1) a special type of memory place should be created and 
(2) that it should be given the name that follows the word int.
 This  command  is called a <b><i>declaration</i></b> because
it declares ( states ) the existence of a new variable.
Once you have declared a variable, you do not need to declare it again.
You simply can use it by writing it again like this.
<br>
mySum = 8;
<br>
Note that I did not use the word <i>int</i> again.
This point often confuses people. Only 
at the time  I am creating the variable and giving it a name do I use the 
special word  <i>int</i>. When I later use the variable,
 I simply write <i>mySum</i>, not <i>int 
mySum</i>.    



<p>


If I were to write again int mySum ; 
the computer would think I wanted to create another variable with
 the same name as the first variable.  This is not allowed and the
 compiler would tell me
 so. In general, I cannot have two variables with the same name. 
If I could have two 
variables with the same name, the computer would not know which one
I meant when I wrote its name. 

<p>
The name or identifier we gave to the variable  is "mySum".
    This is simply the name I have chosen.  I could have used
any name to label this variable.  I could have called it "george".
It is a variable name of my choosing.    From now on in the program, the
 name <b>mySum</b> will refer to
 this variable.   As we said, this is like a  name on the outside of a 
shoebox used to easily identify it.  The name we choose for our
variable does not  affect its contents. (We will 
give the variable some contents in just another moment.) 

<p>
In addition to <i>int</i>, there are 
other such special words in C++ which mean different things.   These special
 words are called <b><i>keywords</i></b>.  They are also called <b><i>reserved
</i></b> words.
Together, all the reserved words make up the C++ language.  The English 
language has about 250,000 words.  C++ has only 62 keywords; that's not too much to learn. 
(There is a table of all of them near the end of this chapter)
We will learn to use most of these keywords.

<p>
 In our case, <b>int</b> means that the type 
of memory space we are creating will be capable of containing whole numbers
 or integers  but not decimal numbers 
(hence the name <b>int</b>, short for integer).
It is as though we 
are creating a shoebox which can only contain one kind of shoe, like sneakers.  Just as there are 
different types of shoeboxes some for sneakers, some larger ones for boots
 there are also 
different types of variables which can contain different kinds of contents 
(for example, ones that can contain decimal numbers instead of whole numbers).  These 
variable type designators are called
<i>primitive data types</i> because they are the most basic (or 
primitive) types of variables that can be created.  Thus, int is a primitive data type.    

<p>
 
The second command:

mySum = 7+8;
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  
puts a value into the variable.  It assigns the value on the <b>right</b> side of the = sign to the 
variable on the 
<b>left</b> side.<br>

 In other words, it puts the value into the shoebox which is labeled 
"mySum."  It gives the variable "mySum" the value of 7+8.    Since 7+8 is 15,
the variable "mySum" gets the value 15.  Now my variable has some content.
Since 15 is a whole number, I can put it into my variable.  I cannot put a 
decimal number like 15.5 into my int variable.  If I would, I would lose the
 decimal part and be left with just 15. In other words, int <b>truncates</b>
the decimal off of a decimal number.
 Later we will see how to store decimal numbers in a different type 
of variable.


<p>



Programmers usually call any line of code which puts a value into a variable
"<i>assigning a value to a variable</i>."   Because such an instruction 
assigns 
a value to a variable, it is  also called an <b><i>assignment</i></b>.    
The = sign is therefore
called the <i>assignment</i> operator because the operation it performs is 
assignment.   (Don't call it "equals" because this is a different concept and
is covered by a  different symbol! ) 
There are other operators that you should know.  The +  (plus) operator
adds two numbers and the - (minus) operator subtracts.  So too there is the /
 (division) operator and the * (multiplication) operator.

<p> In contrast to variables, numbers like 7 or
 17000 or 3.1416 are fixed, that is, their value logically cannot change. 
  7 is always 7 and nothing else. If 7 changes to 8, then it is no longer 7.
Numbers such as these are therefore called <b><i>constants</i></b> 
because their value is constant; it never changes. They are also called 
<b><i>literals</i></b> because they represent literally what they are.
We can assign a constant ( like 7 ) to a variable ( like "mySum" ) but we 
cannot do the reverse.  ( If you think about it,
 it does not make any sense at all to assign a variable to a number.
   In fact,
whatever is on the <b>left</b> side of the assignment operator ( = ) must be
 a variable and never a constant. )  
 Get used to the terms <i>variable</i> and <i>constant</i> and remember the 
difference between them. 
<br>


<p>
 We have seen that first we must assign a name to a variable. 
After this we can assign a value to the variable. 
These two operations together create a variable and give it an initial value. 
This process is a common one and is called <b><i>initialization</i></b>.&nbsp;
<p>
Above, we initialized mySum in two lines of code.  
However these two steps can be combined into one line if we desire.
Here is how:
<blockquote>
int mySum = 7+8;
</blockquote>


<p>After initialization we can assign more values to the variable we 
created.  We can do this any number of times. Each time the old value in the 
variable will be overwritten with the new value.  Here is an example:

<blockquote>
int someVariable = 4500;
<br>someVariable = 25;
<br>someVariable = 200;
<br>someVariable = 1;
</blockquote>
<p>After these four lines  of code, the variable "someVariable"
will have the value 1.  The 4500, the  25 and the 200 have been erased
by being overwritten by 1.

<p>If you want to create several variables in one line of code,
this is made possible by using commas.
Here is an example of a declaring 3 variables in one line.
<blockquote>
int firstVar, secondVar, anotherVar;
</blockquote>
<p>
Now I can use any or all of these variables in my program.  For example, I can 
write:

<blockquote>
int firstVar, secondVar, anotherVar;<br>
firstVar=8; <br>
secondVar=29999;<br>
anotherVar=200;

</blockquote>


<p> 

I can also assign 
the value of one variable to another. 

 In the following example I will assign the value of
the variable <b>a</b> to the variable <b>b</b>.
<blockquote>

int a, b;
<br>a=45 ;
<br>b=a;
</blockquote>

At this point both a and b have the same value, 45 (note: a and b remain different variables).

<br>
 In the next example I will assign the value of
the variable <b>a</b> to the variables <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> by chaining 
together two assignment operators.
<blockquote>

int a, b, c;
<br>a=45 ;
<br>c=b=a;
</blockquote>

At this point both a,  b and c have the same value, 45.
What happened here is that b first got a's value, 45.  Then
c got b's value which by this time is 45.  What fun! Notice also that it
makes sense to read this chained assignment from right to left.

<p> Here is an example of what <b>not</b> to do.  I will attempt
to assign <b>b</b> the value of <b>a</b> before <b>a</b> has any value.
<blockquote>
int a, b;
<br>b=a;
<br>a=45 ;
</blockquote>

 The second line here is faulty.  I cannot assign a non-existing value
of <b>a</b> to the variable <b>b</b>.  Since the program executes 
sequentially, <b>a </b>only
gets the value 45 after the attempt to assign <b>b a</b>'s value.  
This is an error.


<p>As we have said, <b>int</b> is a primitive data type.  
There are other primitive 
data types.
For your future reference, here is a table of all the primitive data 
types along with the amount
of computer memory they use (Bytes) and the maximum and minimum  values
 they can be assigned
 (Range). Look this over and later I will explain each data type.

<p>
We will learn about each primitive data type above as they come up
in the following chapters. But there is one thing I need to explain now.
Shoeboxes are made out of cardboard, primitive data types are made out of
bytes.  You have probably heard the term Megabytes (MB)  or Gigabytes (GB).  
This is how computer or camera memory is measured.  1 megabyte is about 
a million bytes, 1 gigabyte is about 1 billion bytes.
So if your computer has 256MB of memory and an int uses 4 bytes, then you 
can create 
about 64 million ints in your program.  That is a lot, but it is  a finite
 number.
 (I get this number by dividing 256,000,000 bytes by the 4 bytes of one 
int.)  You will notice that in the above chart the number of bytes for 
an int is not given.  This is because the size of an  int depends on the 
computer you are using.  Because of this problem, we have two more primitive
data types:  <b><i>short</i></b> and <b><i>long</i></b>.  Short is an int
 of at least 2 bytes and long is an int
of 4 bytes.  If you know you only need a small integer, you can use
short.  If you need a longer integer you can use
the long data type. This means that really you can always use either a short
 or long in place of int.
According to the chart, the maximum value you can assign
to a short is 32,767.  If you assign a value higher than this - - for example,
32,768  - - to your short variable, the number will get mangled into 
some other number since there is not enough space in a short for this number.
If you need a larger int  you can use long. Now I will 
show you an example of assigning a value too
large to be held in a short. Notice also that I do not use
any commas when I write the value to be assigned.

<blockquote>
short someVariable = 33800;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <b>Wrong!</b>
<br>
long someVariable = 33800;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>Right!</b>

</blockquote>
Purist would say that you should never use the int primitive data type
at all
since it is uncertain what size you will get.  They would say to
always use short if you are working with small values, and long if 
you are working with large values (ones potentially larger than 
32,767).  I agree with this approach in general, but since ints are 
always longs on all 
modern computers,  it is reasonable to use  int when 
you really mean to use a long. But you should feel free to refrain from
 using int altogether and to use
 only longs and shorts instead.
<p>
In the range section of the table, you will notice the words signed and 
 unsigned. This has nothing to do with a signed or unsigned check!
 What it refers to
is whether your int, short or long is also meant to have negative 
values  assigned to it (numbers less than zero). 
If you do not want to assign your variable
any negative values then you can use an <b>unsigned long</b> for example.
The advantage of doing this is that you then can put larger values into the 
variable.  For example, if you declare a variable of type long, the maximum 
value it can be assigned is 2,147,483,647 but if you declare an unsigned
long then you can assign it a value of as much as 4,294,967,295 (but then 
you cannot assign it a negative value). The way you declare an unsigned long,
short or int is by preceding it with the word unsigned.  If you want a signed
variable ( one that can be either positive of negative) simple write
long, short or  int with nothing before it ( you can also write signed before
 the data type, but this is the default anyway so it is not necessary).
<p>
Here is an example of the wrong and right way to do this:


<blockquote>
long someVariable = 3380000000;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <b>Wrong!</b>
<br>
unsigned long someVariable = 3380000000;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>Right!</b>

</blockquote>


<p>
Here is another  example of  an error:


<blockquote>
unsigned long someVariable = -338000;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <b>Wrong!</b>
<br>
long someVariable = -338000;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <b>Right!</b>

</blockquote>



<p>
Now we should discuss what are legal identifiers (variable names).  In algebra we used variable names like
 "x" and "y".  In computer programming, we prefer names that are more descriptive of the purpose
for which the variable is being used.  Some examples of variable names 
are "studentCount" (for
the number of students in a class or whatever), price (for the price of some 
good), age, firstname. You might
notice that the variable names are always nouns (never verbs). Also, if I want
 a two 
word name I capitalize the first letter of the second  word as in 
student<b>C</b>ount. So too, capitalize the second and third words of three
word variable names.
In reality, these rules are really just strong recommendations; the
 computer will let you use any string of letters.  

<p>But there are some hard and fast rules. For example:
<ol>
<li>The first character of the variable must be either a letter, an underscore(_) or a dollar ($).
<li>Any character thereafter can be either a letter, an underscore (_), a dollar($)  or a digit.
<li>You can't use any other symbols or key strokes ( and no spaces either! ).
<li>Variable names are case sensitive ( apple is not the same as aPple).
<li>You cannot use keywords as variable names.
</ol>
 
<p> 
So that you don't accidentally use a keyword as your variable name, here
 is a table of all the keywords in C++. 
So remember: Don't use
 any of the following words as your variable names (identifiers).

<p>
To help clarify what are valid variable names, I made a sample
of some valid and invalid variable names.
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=9> <tr> <td> <h3>Valid</h3>
hello
<br>$_
<br>Study4$
<br>Int
<br>_int
<br>Go$f_r
<br>$read4me
<br>my_int
<br>counter3
<br>bridgeSize
<br>six6
</td><td>

<h3>Invalid</h3>
int
<br>5mice
<br>go away
<br>friend
<br>short
<br>long
<br>&mice
<br>red#
<br>false
<br>90

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<ol>

<li>Describe the difference between a <i>short</i> and a <i>long</i>.
<li>Describe the difference between a <i>variable</i> and a <i>constant</i>.
<li>Initialize one short variable and two long variables (you can 
choose their names).  
<li>Change the value of the above variables to some different value.
<li>Declare another short variable and assign it the value of your 
first short variable.
<li> Add two <b>literals</b> and store their sum in a variable.
<li> Add two <b>variables</b> and store their sum in a third variable.
<li> Multiply two <b>variables</b> and store their product in a third.
<li> Divide two <b>variables</b> and store their quotient in a third.
<li>We saw above that you can assign the value of one variable
to another variable.  We did this like this:
<br>int a, b;
<br>a=45 ;
<br>b=a;
<br>In this case b was undefined until I assigned it a's value (b=a). If b 
had been inialized with another value, it would be overwritten
and lost at this point. This presents an obstacle if I want to
exchange the values of a for b and b for a. Solve this problem.
Write a series of commands so that b is assigned a's value and a is
assigned b's original value.  The solution will require the use
 of a third variable as a holder.
