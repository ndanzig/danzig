<h3>  Virtual Functions</h3>

<p>When writing a program that uses inheritance we can speak of the parent class and the child class.
Since a child class inherits all the attributes and functions of the parent, for all intents and purposes it is a parent,
that is, it can do anything that its parent can do. This is why we call inheritance an "is a" relationship.

<p>For example if class cat is a child of class animal then we can say that cat "is an" animal. This leads to the 
interesting  realization that an animal pointer can point to a child instance.  This is because the the animal pointer
knows how to point to an animal and can run any function in an animal.  Since a cat is also an animal, it can be pointed 
to by an animal pointer.  In general, a parent pointer can point to a child instance (but not the reverse).
The following is an example of  what can be done.

<blockquote>
<code>
Animal *ptr = new cat();
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>This is useful when I want to create a list or array of heterogeneous instances (instances of different classes).
As long as all those classes inherit from a single base class, then I can create an array or
list of pointers of type base class and use this to point to all my different instances.

<p>But what if a certain function exists in the base class but an inheritting class overloads the function,
When I call the function like below, which version of the function will run? The parent's or the child's?
<blockquote>
<code>
Animal *ptr = new cat();
ptr-&gt;myFunction();
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the pointer ptr is of type Animal, it will run the version of myFunction written
in Animal.  How can we make the same code above run the child's version of the function?
What we must do is to define the parent's version of the function as <i><b>virtual</b></i>.
By doing this, the parent "gives permission" to the parent pointer to run the child's version of the function.
Once a function is defined in the parent as virtaul, all descendent's (even grandchildren's) 
versions of the functions will also be virtual. 


<p>Let me repeat this more formally. The virtual keyword means that a parent pointer to a 
 child instance will run the child's version of the function. If the key word virtual is not used
then only the parent version will be run.

<p>For example, if I have a parent class Circle and I want the function getSurfaceArea() to
 be virtual I would define the class like this.

<blockquote><code><pre>
    class Circle
   {
    protected:
          double radius;
          float x;
          float y;
    public:
          static const double pi;
           Circle(float x, float y, double radius);
           double getArea(){return (pi*radius*radius);}
           double getCirc() {return (2*pi*radius);}
           virtual double getSurfaceArea() {return 0;}
    };</pre>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
<p>Now a descendent of Circle (for example, sphere)  can chose to overload the function
 getSurfaceArea() and have his version
run even when being pointed to by a Circle pointer.  The child class can also chose not to overload the function.
In that case the parent version will be run (since there is no child version).

<p>Here is a simplified class that inherits from circle:


<blockquote><code><pre>
    class Simple : public Circle
   {
    public:
           Simple(double r, float x, float y):Circle(x,y,r){}
           virtual double getSurfaceArea() {return 2;}
    };</pre>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>As you see all this class does is overload the function getSurfaceArea().
Now I will create an instance of Simple and point to it with a Circle pointer
and yet I will still run Simple's version of the function.
<blockquote><code><pre>
Circle * ptr;
ptr=new Simple(1,2,3);
ptr-&gt;getSurfaceArea();//will return 2 not 0
</pre></code></blockquote>

<p>Had the function not been defined in Circle as virtual,
the above example would return 0 not 2 since the parent pointer
would only know to run the parent function. 

<p>Writing the word virtual before the function 
definition in Simple is for clarity's sake.  By default once the
function is virtual in the parent, it remains virtual in all children and grandchildren.


<!---   p>One subtle note worth mentioning is that if I do not use the arrow to call
the function, then the virtual effect will no longer work.  In the following 
example the function call will return 0 because I used a static call to the function and
did not use the arrow operator.

<blockquote><code><pre>
Circle * ptr;
ptr=new Simple(1,2,3);
*(ptr).getSurfaceArea();//will return 0
</pre></code></blockquote  --->



<h3>Pure  Virtual Functions</h3>


<p>As we have seen, a descendent of Circle can chose to overload the function getSurfaceArea() and have his version
run even when being pointed to by a Circle pointer.  But the child class can also chose not to overload the function.
In that case the parent version will be run (since there is no child version).
What if I want to force the child to write his own version?  The only way I can do this is to not write
the actual definition of the function in the parent at all. I would just declare that the function exists in
 the parent but not write the function.  This is called creating a <i>pure virtual function</i>.
This will force the child class to implement the parent function.
In a non-pure virtual function the child may choose not to implement the
 function and instead rely on the parent version of the function.

<p>As  a byproduct of giving the parent even one pure virtual function, I can no longer
instantiate the parent class, the parent class has become a <i> pure virtual class</i>.
<p>
This makes sense since it would create problems if I could instantiate the parent class.  What would happent if I 
tried to run the undefined pure virtual fuinction of the parent?  Furthermore, it can be intuitively logical when
the parent class is just a formal construct and not a real thing that I 
would want an instance of.  For example, Animal is a human construct.  Really I should never create
Animals since there are no animals as such, only dogs, cats and sheep for example.
By creating a pure virtual function in a class the class becomes uninstatiatable and I also force the
children classes to write their own versions of the function.  If they don't write it, the compiler will complain and
 I can correct my code before I run it.
If a child does not implement the parent pure virtual function then it too is a virtual class and must be 
inherited by another class which does the implementation.
<p>
The syntax for creating a pure virtual function is like this:
<blockquote><code>
 virtual void myFunction()=0;
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>In my example the function returns void and takes no parameter, but of course this is just
one example, the function could also return an int and take three floats as parameters.
What makes it pure virtual is the "=0".

<p>A great example in which using a pure virtual class would be logical
is when creating a fifo class and a lifo class. Instead of creating two seperate class, 
you could write a class "fo" which would be a
 partial implementation of a fifo/lifo containing just the "push" funtion.
The "fo" class would a have a pure virtual function "pop" that each child
(either fifo or lifo) would implemment.  You want to force the children to 
make their own implementation since the pop behavior is different in a fifo and a lifo
 and you never want an instance of a "fo" to be
 made since the "fo" class is worthless without a pop function implementation.
Obvioulsy the two child classes will implement pop differently, one poping the 
head and the other the tail.  NOw I can create fifo or lifo  instances, but not "fo" instances.


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is a full program using inheritance and a virtual (though not a pure virtaul) function in the parent class.
It is a class circle which has a  child class sphere which inherit its methods and data. A sphere is like a circle but 
it also has a z coordinate.  I chose to implement getSurfaceArea in circle (even though it does not
make much sense) and not to make it a pure virtual function  because I wanted 
to be able to make circle instances.
Cylinder then inherits from sphere since it has all of sphere's attributes but has the additional attribute height.
Once getSurfaceArea is defined in circle as virtual, then it is by default virtual in sphere and cylinder also.

<xmp>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

    class circle
    {
    protected:
      double radius;
      float x;
      float y;
    public:
      static const double pi;

      circle(float x, float y, double radius);
      double getArea(){return (pi*radius*radius);}
      double getCirc() {return (2*pi*radius);}
      virtual double getSurfaceArea() {return 0;}
    };

circle::circle(float x, float y, double radius):x(x),y(y),radius(radius)
{
}

class sphere: public circle
{
protected:
  float z;
public:
  sphere(float x, float y, float z, double radius);
  double getSurfaceArea() {return (4*pi*radius*radius);}
  double getVolume() {return ((4/3)*pi*radius*radius*radius);}
};



sphere::sphere(float x, float y, float z, double radius) : circle(x,y,radius)
{
  this->z = z;
}

class cylinder:public sphere
{
  double height;
public:
  cylinder(float x, float y, float z, double radius, double height);
  double getVolume() {return (getArea()*height);}
  double getSurfaceArea() { return (getCirc()*(radius + height));}
};

cylinder::cylinder(float x, float y, float z, double radius, double height) : sphere(x,y,z,radius)
{
  this->height = height;
}

const double circle::pi = 3.14159;
        
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        
  circle *ptr;
  ptr = new cylinder(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
  cout<<"surface area of cylinder is "<<ptr->getSurfaceArea()<<endl;
  ptr = new circle(1, 2, 3);
  cout<<"surface area of circle is "<<ptr->getSurfaceArea()<<endl;
  cout<<"Area of circle is "<<ptr->getArea()<<endl;
}
</xmp>
