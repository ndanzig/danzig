<ol>
<li>Write a program that print a diamond shape of stars to the screen.
Use only what C++  we have already learned. It should look like this:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br>&nbsp;*****
<br>*******

<li>
The Game of Craps
<br>
 player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces. These faces contain 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 spots. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on  the two 
upward faces
is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw , the player wins.  If the sum is 2,3,or
 12 on the first throw (called "craps" ) the player loses and the house wins.
 If the sum is 4,5,6,8,9, or 10 on the first throw, then that sum becomes the player's point. To win, he must continue rolling the dice until he "makes his point", i.e. rolls the same sum again. If the player rolls 7 before making the point, he loses.
<ul>
<li>Create this game in C++:
<li>write a function int rollDie( void) to simulate the rolling of 2 dice.
   <ul>
   <li>function should return a random number between 1 and 6

   </ul>
<li>write a function int firstRoll ( void) to simulate the first roll.
<ul>
   <li> Function should call rollDie two times.
   <li> It should then return 0 for a winning roll
   <li> It should return -1 for a losing roll
   <li> It should return the  total roll value for non-winning non-losing rolls
   </ul>

<li>write a function int makePoint ( int point) to simulate the later rolls.
<ul>
   <li> Function should get as input the "point" to be made
      <li> It should then return -1 for a losing roll
   <li> It should return 0 for non-winning non-losing rolls
   <li> It should  return 1 for a winning roll

   </ul>
</ul>

<li>Write a program which allows the user to decide how big
of an array he wants to make (use <font color=blue>new</font> command). 
Then, access the array
using pointer arithmatic (not [] ). Allow him to enter student grades 
to the array.
Sort the array. Then print the array contents. Print the average grade. 
Do this by writing seperate function such as sortArray, 
printArray and takeAverage. In these functions you will pass the array
as a parameter (i.e. using *). 

<li> Write a text based computer game: Create a struct called
Warrior which has the following attributes: 1. Name, 2. Type_of_Warrior,
3. Number_of_swords, 4. Number_of_shields, 5. Number_of_arrows,
6. Number_of_limbs, 7. Current_strength, 8. Score. 
Type of warrior can be wizard, elf, goblin, dwarf, footman, horseman.
Current_strength can be from 1 - 10. When the game is run player(s) can 
choose to use a already existing warrior (as found in a file) or they
can create a new warrior. When the game is first run,
there are no warriors yet.  The player(s) can create new warriors which
will get standard values for all attributes depending on the type of 
warrior they choose.  When players finish the game , the game  saves their
 warriors in a file.
<p>Thus, as they continue to play the game, the players may
develop a large set of warriors.

<p>Play is as follows: select two warriors and have them fight.
The game will print who wins and who looses. The winner gets his 
strength increased by one and his score increased by 10 (you may
choose to give him more points if he beats a stronger opponent)
 , the looser gets his strength decreased by two.
Also, by some somewhat random factor, loosers will loose weapons
and winners gain, though sometimes this will be reversed (randomly).
Loosers may also loose limbs!
The program will compute who wins and who looses a given battle
 by comparing the 
relative strengths, weaponry, number of limbs and type of warrior.
Those with higher numbers will usually win, but not always (use a weighted 
random factor). Print who has the top 5 high scores.

<li>Pythagorian Triples -  Write a function which computes all the unique
Pythagorian Triples up to a given value.  A Pythagorian Triple is a set of
three numbers where the square of the first number plus the square of
the second number equals the square of the third number.  For example,
3,4, and 5 are a Pythagorian Triple.  Store the values in a two
dimensional int array.  Make sure there are no multiples of previously
found triple.  For example, 6,8, 10 is also a 
Pythagorian Triple but it is a multiple of 3,4,5.

<li>Write a function which is given a letter (character) and a number.
If the number is the ascii value of the given letter, then the 
function will return boolean true, otherwise it will return boolian false.

<li>Parking garage problem. Chapter 3 , Exercise 3.12 (if you don't have a book
the library should have one.)
<li><i>multiple</i> function. Chapter 3 , Exercise 3.20.
<li> Math Quiz.  Chapter 3 , Do both Exercise 3.35 and 3.36.
<li>Exercise using arrays Chapter 4 , Exercise 4.12.
<li>Another exercise using arrays Chapter 4 , Exercise 4.10.
<li> Dice rolling (use a for loop) Chapter 4 , Exercise 4.17.
<li> Write a program to create a set of names
and phone numbers (stored as a 2 dimentional  <tt>char </tt> array.)
Write the functions addName and changePhoneNumber.  The user can add up to
10 names and phone numbers using addName.  He can change a phone
number of a name using changePhoneNumber and specifying the name for whom
he wants to change the phone number.
