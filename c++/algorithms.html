<p>
In this chapter we will introduce some basic computing algorthms.
The most basic problems involve searching for things in arrays and sorting arrays.
This field of inquiry is very much alive.  For example, this is the main
work that Google  and Wikipedia do.  Coming up with more efficient methods of
searching and sorting arrays can mean real money in the business world.
This chapter will focus on some basic searching and sorting algorithms. 
<h3>Linear Search</h3>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Linear searching is a way to find if a certain element (number , string , etc. ) is in 
a specified array.  The array can be in any order, or be completely
jumbled and this search will find the element if it is there. If the element is found we
 can return the <b> index</b> 
where the element is located in the array.  If the element is not found we can return -1.  We can
assume no array will ever have an negative number as an index. (indexes are always positive
integers.)
Our approach will be to check every element in the array to see if it is
what we are looking for.  We will use a loop to cycle through the array.
Here goes:
<xmp>
int findElement(int yourArray[], int tobefound, int length)// method to find index of specified element
{
     int notfound = -1;
     int counter;
     for( counter = 0; counter < length; counter++ )
          {
	  if(tobefound == yourArray[counter])//check if we found the number we are looking for
	       { return counter;  }
	  }//end for loop
     //if we got this far we must not have found the number
     return notfound; 
}

</xmp>


<h3>Binary Search</h3>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If we have a sorted array we do not need to check every element to find out if the
array contains the element we are looking for.  We can try to narrow down the 
search, by  making the area of the array we check smaller each time.
If we can divide the array in half each time we search it, we 
have improved the speed of our search exponentially.

<p> When trying to guess a number you might ask, "Is it smaller than 5000 ?"
If you receive a positive response you might ask, "Is it larger than 0 ?"
If you again receive a positive response, what would you ask?
You should ask, "Is it larger than 2500 ?".
What ever response you get, you will have reduced the possible numbers by half.
If you received a negative response you should ask, "Is it larger than 1250 ?".
By continuing in this way you reduce the possiblities by half each time.
You will quickly close-in on the correct number.
Since you are dividing the possible numbers by 2 each time, this is called
a <b>binary search</b>.  Since you are cutting the problem down in size each time,
this is also a type of <a href="http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~ped/teachadmin/algor/d_and_c.html" > divide and conquer </a> algorithm.

<p>To perform a binary search on  an array, the array must be is some order.
For example the array must start at the smallest value and end with the 
largest value.  We also need to know the number of elements in the array.
For example, if the array was declared of size 1000, but only 500 elements
actually have values in them, then we need to know the number of elements, 500.
Once we have these two pieces of information, 
can make our first guess as to where the element we are looking for is.
We will guess that our element is in the middle (at index 250) of the array.  
If we are right we are done.  And we simply return the value of the index of the element
(250). But if it is not there, then the element in the middle of the array
is either larger or smaller than the element we are looking for.
If it is larger than the element we are looking for, then we know 
our desired element is in the lower index region of the array (i.e. from
0 to 249).  If on the other hand  it is smaller than the element we are looking for,
then we know that the element we seek is in hte higher index region of the 
array (i.e. from 251 to 499).

<p>Assuming that the middle element is smaller than the number we are looking for,
we will seek our number in hte lower region.  We can now repeat this process by selecting the
middle of the new lower region. I.e., we will guess that our number
is in location 125.  We can then repeat the above process until either we find our element or
the region we are searching has zero elements in it.

<p>Implementing this algorithm using loops (iteration) is not simple and takes some thought
to solve.


A function to do a binary search on a given array can be written recursively.
The base case would be an array of size 1.  
In such a case, if the one number in the array is the number you are looking
for, send back its index, otherwise send back <i>null</i>.
All arrays larger than 1
can be solved by passing one half of the array into the function recursively a second time, 
and so on.
The choice of which half to send back into the function 
will be made by checking if the number to-be-found is larger than the 
element in the <b>middle</b> of the array.
If it is larger, then send the upper half of the array,
if it is not larger, then, if it is not equal to the middle value,
send the lower part of the array back into the function.
If it is equal, simple return the middle index.

<H3>Sorting Algorithms</H3>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If we have an array of numbers in no particular order, we might want to 
sort them into ascending or descending order.  This is called sorting.
The most basic sorting algorithm is called <b>Select Sort</b>.  The principle
of the Select Sort is to traverse the array and find the index
of the largest value.  Then place the largest value at the end of the array.
The array is repeatedly traversed, each time stopping one index sooner.
Each traversal sorts one more number into its final position.
The array will need to be traversed <b>n</b> times where  <b>n</b> is the number of 
elements in the array.
Here is one version of Select Sort:

<pre>

void swap( short sorting_array[], short i, short j );
void sortArray(short vect[], short len);

int main()
{

short array[]={4,6,7,2,67,8,2,44,1,2,7};
 int i;
 for(i=0; i &lt; 11; i++)
   cout &lt;&lt; array[i] &lt;&lt; ", ";
 cout &lt;&lt;  endl;

 sortArray(array, 11);

 for(i=0; i &lt; 11; i++)
   cout &lt;&lt; array[i] &lt;&lt; ", ";
 cout &lt;&lt;  endl;

}

void sortArray(short vect[], short len)
{
  short biggest,i,j;
  for(j=0; j &lt; len ; j++)
    {
      biggest=0; //we will assume the biggest value is at array index 0
      for(i=0; i &lt; len-j; i++) /*each round one largest number is placed in 
			     it correct position at end
			     therefore stop at len-j*/
        if(vect[i] &gt;  vect[biggest] )
	  biggest=i;
      swap(vect,biggest,i-1);
    }
}


void swap( short sorting_array[], short i, short j )
{
  short hold = sorting_array[i];
  sorting_array[i] = sorting_array[j];
  sorting_array[j] = hold;
  return;
}
</pre>



<b>Bubble Sort</b> is another basic sorting algorithm. It gets its name from it 
property of bubbling up larger numbers to the end of the array.  The basic
idea is to compare each number to its neighbor, the larger of the two being 
placed to the index of the higher position (or lower if a descending
sort is desired). Thus, each traversal may move several 
element in the array.  And these movements will
improve the position of these elements.  The is repeated <b> n <sup>2</sup></b> times.
In this sort algorithm, if the elements are only slightly
out of order, the array may get sorted sooner since in one
traversal many elements get adjusted.

Here is a code example :
<p>

<pre>
#define SIZE 10
void main( )
 {
   int my_array[SIZE] = { 2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 12, 89, 68, 45, 37 };
   bool there_was_a_swap;

   showArray( my_array, SIZE );
   for ( int c=0; c &lt;  SIZE ; c++ )
      {
      there_was_a_swap = false;
      for ( int element = 0 ; element &lt;  SIZE-1 ; element++ )
         {
         if ( my_array[element] &gt;  my_array[element + 1] )
             {  
             swap( my_array, element, element + 1 );
             there_was_a_swap = true;
             }
         }//end inner for loop

      if ( there_was_a_swap == false )
          {
          break;
          }
      }//end outer for loop, end sorting algorithm
   showArray( my_array,SIZE );
     }//end main

 void showArray( int array[], int size )
 {
  for ( int c = 0 ; c &lt;  size ; c++ )
  {
   cout &lt;&lt; array[c] &lt;&lt; ", " ;
  }
   cout&lt;&lt;endl ;
  return;
 }
 
void swap( int sorting_array[], int i, int j )
 {
  int hold = sorting_array[i];
  sorting_array[i] = sorting_array[j];
  sorting_array[j] = hold;
  return;
 }
</pre>

<p>
This is called bubble sort because the correct values bubble up to the surface.
After each traversal, not only is the largest number placed at the end,
but other numbers along the way have been adjusted so as to improve their location
in the array.  In some circumstances this may cause the array to
be in correct order sooner. In general,
we must traverse n numbers n times, or n <sup>2</sup>  times. 
But if the array becomes sorted sooner we can stop earlier.  We test this possibility by 
checking if we have traversed the array without making any swaps.  If we made
no swaps then we know the array is sorted already.
We can also improve the efficiency a bit by noticing that we do not need to check the 
last element which was put into its correct place. In my version, I check all the values
every traversal.  You can try to improve the above program by having it
check only the as yet unsorted elements.

<p><b>Insertion Sort</b>
  <xmp>
    void  insertionSort(char array[], int size){
    int i,j, temp;
    for(i=1; i< size; i++){
		for(j=i; j > 0; j--){
                     if (array[j]<array[j-1])
		     {
		        temp = array[j];
		        array[j]= array[j-1];
		        array[j-1]=temp;
		     }
		 }//end inner for
	}//end outer for
    }	     

  
  </xmp>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<ol>
<li>Write an improved version of Bubble Sort which does not check that part of
the array which is already sorted.
<li>Write Select Sort in such a way that it sorts descending instead of ascending.
<li>Write a Select Sort which takes a 2 dimensional array and sorts each row
in ascending order.  You do not need to sort the rows among themselves.
<li>Write a Select Sort which takes a 2 dimensional array and sorts each row
in ascending order.  You should then  sort the rows among themselves.
<li>Write Binary Search for an array of floats.
<li>Write a select sort which can sort an array of strings.  Note that
you will be using a double pointer of type char. You may find it
convenient to use the stringCompare function you wrote in a previous exercise.
<li>Write  a program which can sort either ascendingly or descendingly using either 
bubble sort or select sort.  The program should have a function bubble sort and a function 
select sort.  It should also have functions descending and ascending which accept two ints as parameters 
and return a bool value depending on which is larger.  A fifth function should be passed pointers to the
appropriate functions depending on what the user wants to do.
