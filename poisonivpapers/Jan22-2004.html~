<BR>
My Crohn's is taking a strange turn:&nbsp; the CAT scan of my gut also revealed some irregularities with my liver, of all things, and I am going back to Mountainside Hospital today, for a biopsy.&nbsp; Susan will pick me up in the afternoon.<BR>
<BR>
I'll let you know more when I know more, which could take several days.<BR>
<BR>
Much love and wishes for health, safety, prosperity and happiness to you and all the family,&nbsp; Dad<BR>
