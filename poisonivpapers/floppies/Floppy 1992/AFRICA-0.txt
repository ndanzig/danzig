A group of center-city Newark youth will come face-to-face with a Masai Warrior from Kenya, as an unusual and authentic
 kickoff to African-American History Month, Thursday, January 28, 1993, 10:30 A.M.John Ole Tome, 
a 23-year old member of the Talek tribe with warrior standing (he killed male lion at age 16 with a spear) will address 
a high school class at Newark's Central High School, 100 
Summit Street, to discuss tribal traditions,
 responsibilities of the ®®male and inter-group harmony.
Mr. Ole Tome cuts a 
deceptively slight but imposing figure, standing 6 Ft. 2 In. in his traditional orange robe, ocher-colored braided hair, 
beads and necklace 
and metal spear.  He is visiting the 
United States on a privately-sponsored goodwill trip.

In his native country, John spends his time lecturing on Maasai 
®®culture to tourists at 
the Keekorok Lodge.  It is there he learned to speak English, 
without formal guidance.


The presentation will be made to the class on, "African American Life and History," 
organized by Dr. Julia Miller. 
Dr. Miller is the New Jersey State Director of the "Cities in 
the Schools" program, which focuses on dropout prevention.   Dr. ®®Miller is a well-known educator, 
having Directed the African-American Center at Seton 
Hall University for many years, and has travelled®®widely in Africa.
