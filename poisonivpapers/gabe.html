 <h2>Gabe's Recollections </h2>
<p>
He said that <i>Infinity</i> was an Irish singing group, and although I had
heard from my teacher that it was a mathematical concept, I accepted
Dad's opinion and repeated it with conviction to my teacher.
 </p><p>
He also told me that my geranium plant was not a geranium plant but a
weed that disguises itself as one so that unsuspecting planters will
leave it in place.  There was a philosophical point to be learned from
that.
  </p><p>
He said that as a child he had asked his parents for two presents that he
never received:  a Zebra and a helicopter.
  </p><p>
He used to do Nazi impersonations:  "Vee haff vays of finding out...." 
And then we would have to stick out our tongues, by which he claimed he
could tell if we were lying or not.
  </p><p>
He shot a bird that lived in the tree outside our house, claiming that it
woke him up in the morning.  He also drowned some kittens in a jar of
water.
