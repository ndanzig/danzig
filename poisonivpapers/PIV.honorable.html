Dear friends<BR>
<BR>
I received my 'honorable discharge' 24 hours+ ago and am glad to be home. [I did NOT want to go last week, as I felt weak.]&nbsp; My son Henry paid a special trip up from Florida and was most helpful:&nbsp; what luck I have !&nbsp; He ran a restaurant [or was it two?] for many years and cooked me items the hospital never dreamed of.&nbsp; My appetite came back, which I find among the most incouraging changes.<BR>
<BR>
My son Gavriel will make the longer trip from Israel later in the month, my English friend James will come soon afterwards, as well as Nachum, my youngest.&nbsp; Other geographically distant friends are also making arrangements!&nbsp; What a blessing !<BR>
<BR>
A Visiting Nurse came and she acted intelligently, asking the doctors why I was taking so many diuretics for loss of water, as I was now near my original weight.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems there was too much water retained in my body, some even in the lungs and near the heart !&nbsp;&nbsp; As my daughter-in-Law Rachele noted, 'Sometimes the cure is more dangerous than the disease.' <BR>
<BR>
This condition is being addressed, as was the possibility of infection in the hospital [with massive antibiotics].&nbsp; I am eating well at home and taking a small drugstore-full of various pills, many of which will recede, with time and improvement. <BR>
<BR>
I go for blood test Thursday at Lutheran, will see my doctor, and try to get more information regarding a future [anticipated] schedule of chemo-therpy; dosge; expected reactions now that my initial react is known, under the 'Informed Patient Act.'&nbsp; All-in-all, I have gotten through this first stage and am so pleased the cancer was found early on:&nbsp; all this bodes well.<BR>
<BR>
I will also continue a second consult with Dr. Chung at Sloan-Kettering.&nbsp; I expect another chemotherapy session will be scheduled in a week, or two.&nbsp; Traveling out to Brooklyn [my City of birth] is not that easy, and this is still a major consideration.<BR>
<BR>
I appreciate all the support I have received and know it was so useful and critical emotionally and psychologically; as was the medicine..&nbsp; Compared with all the civilian and military tragedies which occur daily around the world, I am indeed blessed:&nbsp; medically, through friendships and by the Higher Power, for which I am so thankful.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your support.<BR>
<BR>
