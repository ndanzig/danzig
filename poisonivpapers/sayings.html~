 <h2>Dad's Sayings </h2>
<h3>As compiled and recalled by Nachum Danzig </h3>
<h3>Dad would say ... </h3>
<p> If you want to lift something, bend your knees and lift with your legs.
<p> In the Passover Haggadah there are not four questions, but one question and
four answers.  Why is this night different from all other nights? Because
we eat Matzah. Because we eat bitter herbs.  Becasue we dip twice. Because 
we eat reclining.
<p>Most of the fall from a  cliff is not a problem.  It just that last 6 inches 
that gets you.
<p>Most of the people at any tourist site are actually local people. 
(School children on a field trip , etc.)
<p>I never in my life got lost.  Because I am here now. 
<p>Soup is good before a meal, it relaxes your stomache.
<p>Grammar is descriptive not prescriptive.
<p>Human beings are not meant to drink cow milk.  Only young cows should do that.
<p>You have a right to your feelings.  (No one can tell you you shouldn't feel the way you do.)
