<HTML><FONT FACE=arial,helvetica><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=2 FACE="RomanFixedWidth" LANG="0">A couple of weeks ago, I traveled south to Washington, DC, to visit Ruth and Sol Bernards.&nbsp; They were in good spirits, all things considered, and we enjoyed viewing many worthwhile sites.<BR>
<BR>
I arrived on Monday, and met Ruth and Sol for lunch in beautiful Union Station, the grand, recently refurbished gateway to the Capitol City.&nbsp; I rented an auto and we drove out to their new home, the Ring House, in Rockville, MD.&nbsp; They have an airy, cozy apartment, furnished with several familiar pieces from Stewart House.&nbsp; These, together with Ruth and Sol's hospitality, made it easy to feel 'at home.'<BR>
<BR>
Ruth has lectured to the clientele at Ring House, and is rapidly taking her rightful place as a well-known contributing resident there.&nbsp; The interior is nicely appointed and almost the feel of a comfortable, majestic cruise ship.&nbsp; Ruth has made many acquaintances.&nbsp; I found Sol about the same as when I saw him last:&nbsp; his hearing is intermittent and he now uses a 'walker,' but by the second day of my visit, he was asking after my family and things in New York.<BR>
<BR>
That day, we visited the Hirschorn Museum on the mall, seeing their permanent collection.&nbsp; Some of their new pieces are most interesting, especially a glass-fiber gigantic male nude, seen sitting in a corner of the basement, looking back suspiciously at the well-dressed museum-goers.. I discovered that while the Museum was open until 5 PM, street parking was permitted only up to 4 PM.&nbsp; On the way home, we got slightly lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't know whether to go right or left, but a motorcycle police office quickly 'straightened me out.'<BR>
<BR>
The next day,&nbsp; Ruth and I went to the National Holocaust Museum [Sol remained home for his usual morning stroll].&nbsp; It is a most sober exhibit, within an appropriately somber building.&nbsp; It contains a series of some of the most through and understandable exhibits on that nasty and horrific period in European history.&nbsp; There were two 15 minute films: the one on Germany's then-leader went far to permit an understanding of how the population was captivated and hypnotized. <BR>
<BR>
The exhibits also presented what Jewish life had been like before the catastrophe, and included references to the persecution of the Roma [Gypsies] and the euthanasia program, in addition to the Jewish experience. There was a good number of other visitors, most seeming quite middle-American, I was pleased to note.&nbsp; I remained there an hour longer than we had planned.<BR>
<BR>
That night there was a tremendous, terrible summer storm, with leadened clouds, high winds, lightening, thunder and&nbsp;&nbsp; such a great outpouring of rain !&nbsp; From the Bernards' apartment, we could see trees whipped about with water and mud cascading through an adjacent construction site.&nbsp; A metal fence was blown over and I experienced my second blackout for the summer<BR>
<BR>
Wednesday, I drove alone to a nearby Nature Center in Rockville.&nbsp; I noticed many limbs and even trees knocked over from the storm.&nbsp; The Nature center is a small, pretty, recycled design, with displays of turtles, snakes and birds.&nbsp; At its center is wonderful, motley, cracked-mosaic-tile circular mural, depicting aspects of the local natural environment.&nbsp; The artist, Deirdre Saunder, hails from southern Africa [Zimbabwe] and did a colorful job with this 10 ft high, 40 ft long work, containing many 'found' objects.&nbsp; An elaborate country house on the adjacent site, restored by the Town, is also well worth a visit.<BR>
<BR>
The three of us also visited the Roosevelt Memorial, which I&nbsp; had never seen.&nbsp; It is one of the most successful, non-monumental&nbsp; memorials in Washington, and a real pleasure to walk through.&nbsp; It's outdoors, and features four pink-granite enclosed 'rooms,' one for each of FDR's terms as president.&nbsp; Each 'room' contains a waterfall or pool:&nbsp; these relate to the Roosevelt home up the Hudson River; Franklin's stint as Secretary of the Navy; his recuperation in the warm springs at Campabello; his sponsorship of the TVA project and his overseas, wartime travels.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
I particularly enjoyed the sculptures by George Segal especially the one of Eleanor: it reminded me of my truncated conversation with her, so long ago, in an elevator.<BR>
<BR>
That night, the three of us drove to the Kennedy Center for the opening performance of, 'Nijinsky,' a one-man presentation of this world-class dancer from the early part of the previous century.&nbsp; The Center, itself, was rather deserted:&nbsp; Congress being in recess in August: 'Nijinsky' is the only show currently running.&nbsp; The production emphasized Nijinsky the man, his trials and troubles, his relationship with Diagelev and with his daughter.&nbsp; It includes a brief scene of full-frontal nudity, notable mainly, perhaps,&nbsp; because in was exposed in a Federal venue.<BR>
<BR>
All-in-all, the journey was a pleasant summer interlude for me, a unique visit to Washington itself, rather than going there as part of one political demonstration or another.&nbsp; A trip enhanced by the opportunity to enjoy the company of my fast friends, the Bernards.<BR>
