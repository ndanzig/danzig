<BR>
I just wanted to touch bases with each of you and let you know what has been happening here.&nbsp; Not much !&nbsp; However, after 26 days of downpours in the past 50 days, and after a record 10 inches of rain !&nbsp; today was sunny, bright and warm.&nbsp; Some even complained of the heat !&nbsp; I enjoyed it, and went with Heyward Ehrlich to Central Park and a photo exhibit.<BR>
<BR>
Further, starting before my trip but increasingly back here, my stomach has been growling for attention, and I went in for an colonoscopy last week.&nbsp; Dr. Groisser looked it over and said it seemed 'normal' enough, considering my long history with Crohns disease [Ileitis].&nbsp; [It started in 1962, on the day I was graduated from Columbia.]&nbsp; He wants to do a new procedure.&nbsp; It is called 'Remicade,' whereby an I.V. drip 'floods' the blood stream with a protein which neutralizes the problem.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
The problem, by the way, consists of overly active white <BR>
blood cells [you know, the ones that attack bad things like bacteria and, perhaps, virus, and eats them. Ugh ! !]&nbsp; So, in effect, my defensive system is attacking, by mistake, me ! !&nbsp;&nbsp; You can think of it as 'collateral damage,' but, in my case, colonic damage. [Ileum, actually.]&nbsp; Self-criticism.&nbsp; Is it any wonder the Ileitis is relatively prevalent among Jews ?&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, the new treatment tends to neutralize the action of the white cells, thus relieving the disease and the symptoms.&nbsp; It is said to be effective in 60 - 70% of the time.&nbsp; I am looking forward, since my present condition is uncomfortable.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Otherwise, I have a mosaic workshop coming up in July and I need to get my apartment better organized.&nbsp; I promised I would vacate it in October and let a friend use it.&nbsp; I am starting to plan a trip to Israel and neighboring places for that time.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Send me some news when you get the chance.. ..<BR>
<BR>
Much Love&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad<BR>
