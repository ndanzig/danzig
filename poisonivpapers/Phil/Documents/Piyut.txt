Our G-d and G-d of our fathers, forgive us, pardon us, grant us atonement

For we are Your people, and You Our G-d

We are your students, and You our Teacher.

We are Your patients, and You our Doctor

We are Your actors, and You our Director.

We are Your sprinters, and You our Starter.

We are Your football team, and You our Coach.

We are Your baseball team, and You our Manager.

We are Your racecar drivers, and You our Pitstop.

We are Your investors, and You our Financial Advisor.

We are Your internet surfers, and You our System Master.

We are Your subjects, You our Photographer.

We have chosen You, and You have chosen us.
