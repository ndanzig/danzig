<HTML><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><FONT  BACK="#ffffff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Hope you passed an easy fast and a good Shabot.     Want to tell you that Gavriel and family are in town,  --  they came for the day and were to pass on to Florida (and Myrna's apartment) but their plane was delayed 10 Hours.  so they were caught ehre for Shabos.  I met them in the airport and all are well, but tired.  I have a big bag of presents buy only gave out a few, since they were bound for NYC.   <BR>
<BR>
Gavriel asked for you phone #.  I had given him (505) which he dialed, only to become connected to Nicaragua !   He though that was my mistake.   Actually, he forgot to dial the U$A code.<BR>
<BR>
He, Rachele, kids are fine,  We went to Charles Street Shul this morning, and Nachum led the services.  Seems Myrna also inverted him in, but he will be here four days.  I hope to see him, but nothing is definite.  He had highschool friends and two "Dutch girls" to attend to first, but I am sure he will make some time for me.  Myrna has been rather pleasant bout it (the kids are very aware that this is HER trip since she is paying for it).  She wants me to tell Gavriel not to have any more children  --  out of concern for Rachele.<BR>
<BR>
I Went to Naftiali's today, they send regards, as do Holly and Miriam.    I completed a play for Sorie and am now here current "hero,"  She pays me in compliments, which I must admit, I enjoy.<BR>
<BR>
You mentioned you conversation with the woman who was not so happy with the Hasidim.   I had one such at the 6th Street Shul..   I spoke witht eh President of the Board, who was critical of R. Naftali.   "He does things w=his own way.  Spends our money," he complained.   "Who does he attract?    Who are they?"<BR>
<BR>
I pointed out that "they" are Jews, perhaps non-practicing  --  today  --  but in 20 years, if tehre is a Shul, it will be "Them" runnng it, not him.  Then he said, "but they don't even wear kipas!"  so, as we tyalked, I noticed that this gentleman was not waearing a kipa --  I, of couirse, was weating one of my Woody Allen hats.  He looked up, adn they\n changed the subject, broke off to work, ans allowed me to continue measuring the vuilding.  As I left, 30 minutes later, I saw the gentleman, in teh office, going over the books.  with a white, stin "training" kipa on his head.   (Did I make a convert?)<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I would like to see you attorney's brief on you case.<BR>
<BR>
am glad your numbrs are comming out well  --  for my part, I am not experienceing "panic attacks."  My life is less "exciting, I guess,"   But what about you ovary?  Has anybody looke at it?  There was a growth, I believe you said -- if this is not too personal a question.<BR>
<BR>
I am slightly envious of your computer.  You have a 19 In. screen?  That's huge ! ! !   How much did you pay ofr oit, if that's not asking too much.  I see them here for $600, which seems to be about what you paing for your whole system !  Your brother must be a gunius.   What brand was it?  I see SONY 19 In for $600 and toher brands for $400, but are they any good?  <BR>
