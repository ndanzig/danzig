<H2>PUTTING ON THE MASK</H2>

<PRE><tt>
When a person picks out a mask, and puts it on
places it carefully before their face
covers his hair and tucks the flaps behind his ears
 he becomes that mask,
or, at least, he thinks so,
even if that mask doesn't become him.

So when you see your friend, or a stranger,
wearing a mask, they are that mask,
playing their part, for their part,
and can never see the unseemly edges
credibility gaps
That you may see.  

Peter says, a snarling doe was frightened
before it scurled it lip.
That laughing lady may be uneasy       (was)
before she stepped into the party room.
The sabre may be rattling out of fear
and not bravado.
The seductive smile, disco cheeks and hot pants
may be covering up a fridgid interior.

(natural)
That gushing water fall may be screening
a cave of manipulation     (dead men)
That altogether story, linked by anecdote,
flowing out so strong,
may be put together by lies and tears,
telling of persons out to-get-her
the innocent victims of her own monstuous
fantesty.

Then if you know this, you must speak
as though you were addressing the mask,
but pitch the point of your remarks
to the person behind the mask.
But if you reveal that you see
what they are trying to conceal
Your work cannot be reeived.
Deflected by the mask, they bounce off rubber ears (fall on rubber ears)
They do not reach the person within,
Furiously holding on to the unraveling strings
of their mask, a mask put on to fool the world
within.
