[This is a further journalistic entry concerning my fortuitous discovery in January, 2004, of cancer cells in my abdomen, and my struggle with this shocking, new condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the twin exigencies of accuracy and recuperation, there is an&nbsp; editorial delay of several weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Phillip<BR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>LIFE IS DAMAGE CONTROL<BR>

The next week, I received my first five Poison I.V. potions designed to kill new, fast-growing cells, such as cancer, blood cells and hair.&nbsp; Despite my apprehensions regarding what I had heard of chemotherapy, my first over-night went easily enough.&nbsp; Nor did my discovery that&nbsp; my room-mate in my semi-private room, in the well-appointed qxqFive Eastqxq suite, was a man named Mort disturb me.&nbsp; We chatted, he soon left and then I went home, feeling pleased.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned the<BR>
following week to test out the condition of my white and red blood cells.&nbsp;&nbsp; These were low, so I received two injections [Neupogen and Arnaesp] and was told to return again the next day.&nbsp; My main perceived symptom was hiccuping.<BR>
<BR>
The next day, after a skimpy breakfast, I took the hour-long subway trip and slowly mounted the steps and crossed the subway mezzanine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly faint, I stepped over to a large green trash<BR>
basket and reached out to steady myself.&nbsp; At that point, my knees turned to rubber and I found myself collapsing towards the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never lost consciousness but remained seated in the middle of the mezzanine, just another elderly man in an overcoat, the object of qxqrubber-neckingqxq by the curious commuters, pretending to contemplate my navel, philosophically.&nbsp; It was 8:58 AM.<BR>
<BR>
The Station Agent called 911, and soon I was taken to the Emergency Room of the Lutheran Medical Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fully conscious, I pointed out that I did not belong there, but should be taken to the Oncology suite, on the Fifth Floor, where I was expected.&nbsp; But now I was no longer the<BR>
qxqCancer Patient,qxq but, rather, qxqThe man who took a fall in the subway.qxq&nbsp; I knew immediately that the ER staff would soon begin to inspect every organ, tissue, fluid and bone of my body.&nbsp; This could take six hours, when all I&nbsp; needed were more white and red blood cells: badly.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
I checked out the activity in the ER, and tried to phone qxqFive East,qxq upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No such luck.&nbsp; Watching the parade of out-patients in the ER, and feeling them sneeze and cough,&nbsp; and hearing&nbsp; their qxqsneezles and wheezles,qxq I became alarmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I called out to a Doctor, qxqLook, Iqxqm a cancer patient and I belong upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a compromised immunity system.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to get out of here !qxq&nbsp; To his credit, he immediately placed me into a qxqReverse Isolationqxq room, where I remained for the next 12 hours.<BR>
<BR>
Seems they had misplaced my emergency admission records.<BR>
<BR>
I finally did make it to my qxqHome Away from Home,qxq in the qxqFive Eastqxq Suite, and remained there for the next nine [9] days.&nbsp;&nbsp; My immune system was virtually non-existent [White = 0.1; Red =] 1.2] and I received one unit of blood and massive doses of anti-bacterial medication, to prevent opportunistic infections from arising.&nbsp; These drugs induce qxqDrowsinessqxq and warn against operating heavy farm machinery.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I was able to flick the TV remote, make telephone calls and manipulate the contortions of my hospital bed.<BR>
<BR>
Much of this period remains a blur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The days passed into hours and the hours evaporated.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to meet a slew of Nurses, Nurseqxqs Aids, the Concierge, Dietitians, Cleaning Personnel, House-keepers, Hematologists and at least one Psychiatrist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intravenous fluids continuously dripped<BR>
into my veins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I exhibited strange symptoms, such as an increase of hiccuping, total loss of appetite, incredible weakness, and what appeared to be elephantiasis [edema].&nbsp; I&nbsp; made burgundy-colored, cloudy water and contracted fungus in my mouth and nether regions.&nbsp; I had always thought that fungus grew on rocks and trees?<BR>
<BR>
I stopped shaving and stopped combing out my hair.&nbsp; [Taking chemotherapy means you never have to visit your barber ever again.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several friends kindly took the long trip from Manhattan to visit, offering gifts:&nbsp;&nbsp; but all I wanted was a set of three new menqxqs briefqxqs, medium.&nbsp; [I had gone there as an out-patient.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, I had brought my Sidur.&nbsp; And I telephoned friends, relatives and acquaintances in Manhattan, New Jersey, Florida, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, England and South Africa , and, of course, Israel.&nbsp; Rabbi Meir Fund visited, with his wife.<BR>
<BR>
I made some interesting realizations:&nbsp;&nbsp; When you shut your eyes, you do not really stop qxqseeing;qxq you can still qxqseeqxq but there just is nothing to look at.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amd, I could stare happily at a spot on the ceiling for several hours, not moving, wondering, qxqWhatqxqs the point?qxq&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw many National<BR>
Geographic documentaries, noting that the bigger animals eat the smaller ones and the very smallest were often quite photogenic.<BR>
<BR>
I was shocked at a program depicting two men and a woman in a boat trying to rescue two feral dogs in a lake.&nbsp;&nbsp; I complained to the Housekeeper who asked, qxqYou donqxqt like dogs ?qxq&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
qxqSure I do,qxq I told her, qxqbut there are 4 million Aids orphans in South Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp; How much did this dog rescue program cost ?&nbsp; Imagine what my medical bills will be; and they canqxqt&nbsp; even find $375 for AZT to save each child in Africa.qxq<BR>
<BR>
qxqYou donqxqt have good medical insurance ?qxq she asked me.<BR>
<BR>
qxqSure I do,qxq responding.&nbsp;&nbsp; qxqSocial Security and Blue Cross-Blue Shield.qxq<BR>
<BR>
qxqWell,qxq she laconically rejoined,&nbsp; qxqI donqxqt have good Medical Insurance.&nbsp; I belong to Union 1199.qxq&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
So I found a caste system in the Hospital, not unlike the rest of the world.&nbsp; The foreign-trained work in the middle, speaking Jamaican, Colombian, Filipino, Indian, Sla vic and Russian.&nbsp; Then Spanish and many African-Americans labor at the bottom;&nbsp; with Caucasion Doctors and Physicianqxqs Assistants, characteristically wearing white coats, floating past like Alto Cumulus clouds.<BR>
<BR>
And I discovered that my body was going through some bizarre, incomprehensible, temporary changes, only loosely and tentatively attached to my soul. <BR>
