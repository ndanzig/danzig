RE:	NATHANIEL HARDY  V.  HERMAN SOMMER;  METCO;  ET AL
	YOUR FILE   #52429-L


Gentlemen

On June 8, 1998, you requested that I determine who was responsible for an accident that was alleged to have occurred on or about August 16, 1995, to Nathaniel N. Hardy, Jr., Head Custodian, resulting from him stepping on unsecured pipes in the boiler room of the Oliver Street School, Newark, New Jersey.  You gave me documents relating to this matter.     I examined them in June, 1998, and subsequently, and, more recently, spoke with a Mr. Bob Bowser, Engineer, by phone on Saturday, September 12, 1998, and submit the following observations and opinions:


	I  --  METCO HAD CONSIDERABLE PIPING MATERIALS ON THE JOB DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACCIDENT IS ALLEGED TO HAVE OCCURRED:	The documents show that at the time of the accident (August, 1995) METCO (or, Maytor Corp., Inc., a.k.a. Tullo, a.k.a. Pennetta) held three (3) contracts with the Newark Board of Education (a.k.a. Newark Public School District), Owner, to effect oil to gas boiler conversions on approximately ten (6 - 10)  schools.  The Oliver Street School was authorized under Contract #016095/3606.    The Contract price was $186,444.00, and consisted, in part, of the installation of Gas Piping valued at some $33,330.00 (or $35,330.00 -- there is some conflict in METCO?s payment schedule, as submitted).   

	 1)  METCO HAD NO PIPING ON THE JOB PRIOR TO JULY 25,  1995:     METCO submitted their first Periodic Estimate for Partial Payment [File #016095] to the Owner on July 25, 1995 at the start up of the project.   Ten items were listed, of which ?GAS PIPING? was Number 2.   But no payment was requested for ?Gas Piping? at this time.   This Payment Request was signed by Victor Pennetta, President of METCO, and notarized by Maryann Hanson.  The payment request was marked ?Received? by the Owner, dated August 10, 1995.

	 2)  BETWEEN JULY 25, 1995, AND AUGUST 29, 1995,  METCO HAD DELIVERED PIPING WORTH $33 - $35,330.00 TO THE JOB.     On August 29, 1995, approximately one month after the first request and thirteen (13) days after the alleged accident, METCO sent in their second Payment Request, on File #016095, covering the previous month.   Here, two items were presented for payment; ?GAS PIPING,? item No. 2, for the amount of $35,330.00; and item No. 3, for ?BURNERS/GAS TRAINS,?  for $50,000.00.   This second Payment Request was also signed by Victor Pennetta, President of METCO, and notarized by Maryann Hanson.  The request was marked ?Received? by the Owner, dated September 11, 1995.

By submitting this item for payment, METCO asserted that the piping aspect of the work was finished.  That is, all required piping had been purchased, delivered and/or installed in its entirety between the dates July 28 and August 29, 1995.  This is the period when the Head Custodian, Mr. Nathaniel Hardy, was injured.   During this period,  the record shows that METCO testified that some $35,000.00 of gas piping was procured.   Mr. Victor Pennetta, signing for METCO, caused the payment request to be notarized and submitted to the Owner.  Thus, on behalf of METCO,  Mr. Pennetta attested to the following Declaration, as printed on all such Partial Payment requests submitted to the Board:

I do solemnly declare and certify under the penalties of the law that the within bill is correct in all its particulars, and that the articles have been furnished or services rendered as stated therein ... that the amount therein stated is justly due and owing, and the Amount charged is a reasonable one.

This second Payment Request was approved and certified by the Owner?s supervising Engineer of Record, Martin Behr, Jr. PE., with the following words, which are printed on all such Partial Payment requests:

In accordance with the Contract Documents, based on  on-site observations and the date comprising (this) application, the Architect (read: Engineer) certifies to the Owner that to the best of his knowledge, information and belief the Work has progressed as indicated,  the quality of the work is in accordance with the Contract Documents, and the Contractor is entitled to payment of the AMOUNT CERTIFIED.	
	
In addition to these two (2) Declarations and Certifications, there follows five (5) additional Certifications and signatures of officers representing the Owner.  They held the following supervisory titles:  Construction Manager, Project Manager, Director of the Office of Design and Construction and Executive Director of the Board?s Purchasing Department.   All six attest to the proper delivery and installation of the item(s) for which payment is requested.

Thus, there could hardly be clearer evidence, authentication or confirmation by half a dozen persons, that, in fact, between the dates of July 25, 1995 and August 29, 1995, METCO and/or its agents, caused to be delivered and set in place some $35,300.00 worth of GAS PIPING, which they were under contract to procure and install in the Oliver Street School.    The boiler room was the location for storage of materials on this job.

This quantify of materials purchased by METCO and delivered to the site corresponds to the large amount of piping listed in the deposition of Mr. Gregory Condon, Senior Engineer with METCO Pennetta, given on May 7, 1998,    He stated the materials as follows:  

?Four-inch (4?) gas pipe.  Probably had some two and-a-half (2 1/2?), probably had some EMT, probably had some Greenfield, probably had some burner components, probably had some McDonald Miller 57 lower cutoffs.?  (Pages 18, 19.)

?I would say the largest it would be is probably two and a quarter 2 1/4?), but it could be as small as probably one and three-quarter 1 3/4?).?   (Page 51.)

There is some ambiguity in Mr. Condon?s deposition regarding the length of piping required.   First, he said that, ?The gas meter was located in the same room so maybe this one took, I don?t know, 60 foot.?   (Page 14.)   Next, he estimates an additional 10 feet around the burners.  When pressed, he says, ?I don?t know.  I don?t know, I didn?t measure...We?ll say approximately 10 foot per boiler, it?s three boilers, 30 feet....Its a pretty good guess.?  (Page 15.)    It would thus appear, according to Mr. Condon, that METCO required only 90 feet of piping for the Oliver Street project.    It is difficult to understand how this small amount of piping, could have been valued at $33 - 35,330.00.

Mr. Condon does not mention vent piping through the roof, or gas supply piping to auxiliary units such as Hot Water Heaters or Emergency Electrical Generators.

In his deposition, Mr. Condon justified the small amount of piping required, saying, ?the gas meter was located in the same room,? as the boilers.   It is preferable in the industry to locate the gas meter in a room separate room from the boiler room, for obvious reasons.  In a conversation I had by phone on Saturday, September 12, 1998, with Mr. Bob Bow- ser, the supervising Engineer for the Board?s Office of HVAC at the time of the alleged accident, Mr. Bowser said the meters are located in a room separate from the boiler room.  I cannot verify this discrepancy since neither the Engineer?s plans nor the required shop drawings nor the required As Built drawings concerning ths project have been made available.   In the event I gain access to the space, a more positive determination on this, and other relevant, points can be effected.

	  3)  THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT METCO RECEIVED THIS PIPING:  Mr. Condon later substantiated and agreed that METCO had had these materials on the job on the day of the accident, in the area marked ?piping,? which was where the accident was supposed to have occurred.  (Page 52,)    Further, the Specifications of the Engineer require the Contractor to, ?Furnish and install a new 2-1/2 ? gas piping system from the meter to the burners.   (And shall)  Furnish and install 2-1/2? gas piping from each gas train to each burner.   (s. 15650.)   Also, The Contractor shall, ?Furnish and install a gas piping supply system from the meter to each boiler burner.?  (s. 15650-9.)

A fuller description of required gas piping includes such items as main overhead piping and drop piping to each burner, hangers for suspending pipes, plastic pipe for sleeves through the walls, and vent piping between all components and the atmosphere.   It also includes a gas piping to domestic appliances.


	II -- FLAWS IN METCO?S PROCEDURES:	 The numerous reports and documents detailing the project show that METCO?s administration of this job was  flawed, from the beginning.   This lack of managerial control, including inattention to stor- age and safety issues, created a situation in which an accident was likely to happen.  These include inadequate cleanup operations , the neglect of safety and storage requirements, inappropriate administrative procedures such as a premature start-up without authorization, and inadequate directions to sub-contractors, .    Taken altogether, these problems constitute a pattern of inefficiency, disorder and inadequate attention to storage and clean-up on the job.   These problems were evident to the representatives of the Owner, as well as to METCO?s own sub-contractors, and are noted, below.

	  4)  METCO BEGAN THE JOB WITHOUT APPROVAL:  In a letter addressed by Mr. Greg Condon, Senior Project Manager of METCO, to Mr. James Kokkalis, Director of Design and Construction, and dated June 26, 1995, Mr. Condon apologized for starting the project prior to being authorized to do so by the Board, with his assurance that, ?per your instructions ... METCO has stopped all work on our current pending contracts.?   (METCO had managed to invite a notice by the Board on June 30, 1995, informing them that, ?until you receive a fully executed contract and/or notice to proceed in writing, you may not proceed with any work or ordering of any  materials.?)

	  5)  Three days later, on June 29, 1995, METCO finally transmitted to the Owner their essential documents.   Without these required materials, the Owner, a public governmental agency, cannot legally authorize a contractor to Proceed.   Materials include:  Performance Bonds, Certificates of Insurance, Affirmative Action Statements, Manning Reports, List of proposed Sub Contractors and List of Contact People.

	  6)  MILLER & CHITTY NOT ON APPROVED LIST:   METCO?s official Sub Contractor Listing, as sent on July 5, 1995, by the Department of Purchasing to the Office of Design and Construction, contains the names of three (3) approved subcontractors for this project, but did NOT include Miller & Chitty Co., Inc.    I have seen nothing to explain or approve of the subsequent use of this firm as Subcontractor by METCO. 

	 7)  The official Notice to Proceed was released by the Division of Purchasing to METCO (copies to D&C) on July 5, 1995.   The Oliver Street Gas Conversion Project was one among six (6) [perhaps ten (10)] contracts assigned to METCO.  The Notice was signed by Paul J. Donohue,  Director of Purchasing.

	 8)   METCO WAS WORKING ?ON THE JOB? AT THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED:    The Owner?s ?Boiler/Burner Gas Conversion -- Inspection Check-List,? dated August 24, 1995, indicates the amount of completed/not completed work at the Oliver Street School.   It shows that although the work had begun, significant work was NOT completed.  For example, by August 24, the demolition work required before installing gas piping, was Not Completed (NC).  Finally, it shows that whereas the gas piping from meter to boilers was Completed (C), the Gas piping Tie-in to domestic appliances, HW heaters and emergency generator was Not Completed (NC).   This report was signed by the Inspector for the Board?s Inspector for Design and Construction, Joe Imperiale.   [Incidentally, it also shows that the boiler work to be performed by the Board?s  HVAC Division and/or the Custodian was Completed (C).]  

	 9)  METCO?S COORDINATION OF ITS SUB CONTRACTORS WAS FLAWED:  A letter from METCO?s subcontractor, Miller and Chitty, dated August 28, 1995, and addressed to Greg Condon of METCO, complains about what appears to be confusion in the timetable (work flow schedule) on the project.   It reads, in part:  

The front blowdown piping is centered where the gas piping goes into the gas housing on all three (3) units.  We will remove the blowdown piping to fit the gas piping in  and your piping guy can re-route the blowndown piping when he returns.

Unit L - 52729 #3 is getting new refractory by others.  The existing housing was off this unit with broken studs and new liner tiles are installed but there are no throat tiles installed.  Usually these throat tiles have to be installed first before the throat tiles so we don?t know what is going on here.  As the seal between the throat tiles and new gas housing is critical, we cannot complete the gas conversion on #3 until the throat tiles are installed .

This letter, signed by Mr. Dave Balogh, suggests that METCO had contracted out much of its work but that coordination between METCO?S various sub-contractor?s and their own work crew left something to be desired.   This letter implies a flawed construction schedule, out of proper control.    It also suggests that Mr. Condon was not personally aquatinted with the progress of the work.

These statements lead me to conclude that in addition to METCO?s own labor force handling pipes, their sub-contractor, Miller & Chitty Co., Inc., was also removing pipes and storing them somewhere in the boiler room.

	10)  A memorandum on the subject of missing burner parts at the Oliver Street School from Satish Desai, addressed to file and dated October 13, 1995, states that Miller and Chitty Co., Inc. is the subcontractor for METCO, and ?is performing the actual conversion work including the installation of gas trains an all three (3) (100 H. P.) boilers.?

	11)  METCO FAILED TO MAINTAIN CLEAN JOB CONDITIONS:   The Field Report of the Owner?s Project Manager, dated September 5, 1995, (three weeks after the accident) bespeaks of the disorderly and negligent condition of the boiler room during this period.    The Field Report states that, ?Debris and material is still laying all over the floor.?    A supplemental note, dated September 7, 1995, adds that, ?Debris same.  P. S.   (Public Service) repaving street trench.?   This is corroborated by the deposition of Mr. Condon, who, when asked if there was any employee of METCO that was specifically responsible for the cleanup of the work site on a day-today basis, replied, ?No, not an appointed one.?  (Page 45.) 

	12)  METCO DID NOT COMPLETE THE PROJECT ON TIME:  The Field Report of the Owner?s Project Manager, dated November 1, 1995, shows that the project was only 65% completed by that date.  The project had been contracted to be completed within 90 days of the Notice to Proceed, or by October 6, 1995.    Heat was required to be available to the school by October 15, 1995.    In his report, the Project Manager states that he, ?Checked main gas train.   Is installed -- working.  Burners connected to boilers, boiler #1, #2 on line.  Items ... that needed to be done included hangers needed on gas pipes.?   This report was signed by William Hagen.

	13)  AFTER 8 MONTHS, METCO HAD STILL NOT FINISHED, AND THE BOILER ROOM WAS STILL GREASY:   A letter addressed to the attention of Victor Pennetta, President of METCO, and dated March 5, 1996, from the Owner, attests to the incomplete and nasty condition of the Oliver Street School project, fully nine months after the Notice to Proceed.   This strongly worded letter, signed by Satish Desai,  reads, in part:

	In spite of constant communication with your project manager, Greg Condon, since early January, 1996, and the agreement of completing all punch list work by February 29, 1996, we have noticed that significant amount of work is still outstanding.

It is noted that the fuel oil, oil sludge, cleaning material etc. generated from the removal of the fuel oil equipment in each boilerroom, shall be removed and disposed of in a legal and approved manner as per contract specifications.   All boilerroom floors must be degreased and steam cleaned/washed as per specifications....

	Failure to comply will result in:

1.	Denial  of subsequent payment applications and/or completion of above mentioned work by district?s in house maintenance personnel or outside contractors and backcharge you for the same,

2.	Notification of unsatisfactory contractor?s evaluation report to state of New Jersey, Division of Building and Construction and your bonding company.


	14)  METCO WAS EVALUATED AND GRADED AT LESS THAN 80% BY THE OWNER,  FOR ITS LACK OF SUPERVISION AND ITS DELAY IN CLEAN UP:    The Owner?s ?Contractor Evaluation Report,?  dated June 20, 1996, gave a rating of 77.9 % to METCO for its work on the Burner Gas Conversion project at the Oliver Street School.  This unfavorable rating was due:  A)  to a failure to provide ?required supervision on the project site,? which,?caused interruption of services at various instances,? and,  B)  for a failure to perform, ?punch list items (clean up) promptly as required by the contract.?   The Owner?s Project Manager,  Mr. Satish Desai, elaborated with the comment, ?Very slow progress on completion of punch list work and incorrect reporting on the status of completion of punch list work.?

This finding of a failure to provide required supervision, and failure to maintain a clean and neat work environment, is indicative of METCO?s administrative history.
 

	III -- METCO?S FLAWED SAFETY PROCEDURES:	METCO?S contract with the Owner requires it to submit a storage plan, to appoint a safety officer, to take safety precautions,  to write up accidents should they occur and to follow OSHA requirements.  In fact, my examination of the documentation fails to reveal any evidence that METCO filed the required storage plan, put up signs, construction tape or cones and so forth, and failed to report the accident which occurred, although they knew about it, or to adhere to any safety requirements.

NATHANIEL HARDY  V.  HERMAN SOMMER;  METCO;  ET AL -- FILE   #52429-L

	15)  METCO WAS REQUIRED BY CONTRACT TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF PERSONNEL AT THE SITE:   The Special Conditions of the Contract (SC-03) state that, ?The Contractor shall conduct his work in a manner not to obstruct the passage of the school personnel to or from any part of the site.  The Contractor shall ... remove all debris....?   (s. SC-1).   Further, the Contract states that, ?The Heating Contractor is to at all times during the progress of his work, remove his rubbish and excess materials, so that they do not create fire, health, or safety hazards inside the building.?   (s 15000-11)   The Contract also requires that:  ?Materials and equipment are to be stored on the site in areas designated and approved by the Owner, in a manner conducive to safety of all persons passing by.?   (Emphasis added  --  s. 16100.2.) 

	16)  METCO FAILED TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SAFETY OFFICER AT THE SITE  RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCIDENT PREVENTION :    In addition, the Contract?s Section K -- PROTECTION OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY, requires that

The Contractor shall be responsible (for) maintaining and supervising all safety precautions and programs in connection with the Work.   He shall designate a responsible member of his organization at the site (emphasis added) whose duty shall be the prevention of accidents.  (p. 21.)

According to his own deposition, given May 7, 1998,  Gregory Condon, the Senior Engineer for METCO Pennetta, indicates, however, that he never complied with this regulation.  After admitting that he was METCO?s Safety Officer, he was asked whether he stayed on the job.  His answer (page 7) was a flat, ?No.?  When asked how often he visited the site during its nine month duration, he answered, ?I?ve been at his particular site at least two dozen times.?   (Page 8.)    

	17)  METCO APPARENTLY FAILED TO TAKE ANY ACTION AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT:	According to his deposition, Mr. Condon, being METCO?s Safety Officer, did not visit the site to investigate the accident, did not secure the site or ascertain whether there were safety violations there which may have contributed to the accident, and did not write up an accident report.   


	IV -- CONCLUSION:	Based on my consideration of the documentation submitted to me concerning this matter, and on my many years of experience as a registered Architect in designing and supervising construction in the building industry, and on my knowledge of the procedures and codes commonly followed there, I have determined that METCO (or, Maytor Corp., Inc., a.k.a. Tullo)  


September 14, 1998
Freeman and Bass
NATHANIEL HARDY  V.  HERMAN SOMMER;  METCO;  ET AL -- FILE   #52429-L
Page nine


I.   Had a considerable amount of piping material on the job during the period in 	which the accident occurred,  that 
II.  There were serious flaws in METCO?s supervisory and administrative 	procedures, as noted by representatives of the Owners, and others, and that  
III.  METCO?s safety procedures were flawed.

It is, therefore, my conclusion, that METCO, together with its Sub Contractors which it hired to perform work or services on this project, was essentially responsible for the presence of piping and other construction materials in the subject boiler room, and for the storage and arrangement of such, but permitted these materials and debris to lay about the floor in disregard of its responsibility to provide for the safety of all persons passing by.    This failure to take adequate and safety precautions is particularly egregious in this case since the work space and storage space where METCO operated, the boiler room, was the entry way to the working office of the school?s Head Custodian, Nathaniel Hardy.

Furthermore, at least one of their Sub Contractors, Miller & Chitty, is significantly responsible as well, since it was working in the boiler during the same time period, and became involved in removal of the blowdown piping to fit the gas piping and its subsequent storage  prior to its re-routing by METCO?s workers, when they would return.

METCO?s apparent disregard of proper storage methods, their failure to put up signs, construction tape, cones and so forth, their failure to assign an on-the-job Safety Officer or to report an accident which occurred, are in violation of common sense, the safety provisions of their Contract, and the governing regulations of OSHA.   Such failures and violations create the environments in which persons unused to construction conditions frequently suffer serious injury, requiring them to appeal for appropriate relief through the legal system.


 	V -- HERMAN SOMMER & ASSOCIATES HAD CONTRACTS WITH THE BOARD AT OR NEAR THE SUBJECT PERIOD:     With regard to Herman Sommer & Assoc., the documents show that they held two maintenance contracts with the Owner during throughout the relevant period, in the approximate amount of $100,000.00 These could be applied to any/all District Schools, including  Oliver Street.   One was for retubing boilers and associated boiler repairs, and  the other for refractory work (fire brick).

Nevertheless, this data indicates that the firm only performed retubing in October and December of 1994.    But it also indicates that this firm did work at the Oliver Street School during 1995.   This work, however, may have been formally limited to replacement of fire brick, not tubes.   This  would seem to be confirmed by payment documents from the Owner which show refractory (firebrick) work (July 24, 1995 in the amount of  $865.00);  baffle tile work and doors (July 28, 1995 in the amount of $3,143.00);  and burner tile work (October 3, 1995, for $912.00).     This is a total billing of $4,920.00.

However, when Herman Sommer completed its retubing project in the Oliverstreet School in 1994, they may have left retubing material there (in anticipation of returning).   The data does not indicate the state of the workroom when METCO first came on its job.

	18)  HERMAN SUMMER MAY HAVE COMPLETED ITS JOB AT SOME PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT:    A letter from Mr.  Robert Bowser, of the Owner?s Office of HVAC, to Mr. John Golombuski, of the Office of Design and Construction, states that the work of Herman Sommer on the Oliver Street School?s boilers would be completed by July 28, 1995.   This indicates that Sommer?s workforce (and materials) may have been out of the school before the accident occurred.    

In fact, the Owner?s ?Boiler/Burner Gas Conversion -- Inspection Check-List,? dated August 24, 1995, states that, ?The boiler work to be performed by the Board?s HVAC office and/or the Custodian was Completed.?   This may refer to the work of Sommer, who was supervised by the Board?s HVAC office.     In a conversation I had by phone on Saturday, September 12, 1998, with Mr. Bob Bowser, the supervising Engineer for the Board?s Office of HVAC at the time of the alleged accident, he indicated that the policy in effect between the Board?s Office of HVAC and its Office of Design and Construction at the time (1995) was to require that Contractors hired by the former (HVAC) to complete their work prior to the start of  work contracted by the latter (D&C), as far as possible.

	19)  HERMAN SOMMER MAY HAVE LEFT MATERIALS, OR WORKED AT THE SITE DURING THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED:   Nevertheless, since Herman Sommer was required to return to the Oliver Street school to perform additional burner tile work on October, 1995, the company may have left construction materials in the space.    And although the relevant payments refer to ?refractory work,? ?baffle tile work,? and ?burner tile work,? there is no positive information showing conclusively that Sommer did no pipe replacement during this period.  Furthermore, they might have had to remove/replace pipes in order to complete their assignment.   Finally,  Mr. Gregory Condon?s deposition, given on May 7, 1998, states that Herman Sommer and Associates were re-tubing the boiler at the time of the alleged accident, so the record is not crystal clear in this regard.

	V -- CONCLUSION:     After reviewing and reexamining this data, I find the information regarding the involvement of Herman Sommer and Associates vague and contradictory.  While they certainly were working in the boiler room before and after the time of the accident, and may have done work involving piping and/or tubes, there is little or no substantial evidence confirming, or denying, their presence there in August.  In fact, since this firm had employees at the School, actually in the boiler room surrounding the time in which the accident occurred, they may have stored their own equipment, there, or moved or relocated tubes and piping belonging to others, thereby precipitating the accident.   In any event they undoubtedly possess information relevant to the issue of responsibility for the condition of this space.


	NOTE:	I believe that I was constrained from reaching a more definite conclusion in this matter, due to the lack of some important and relevant details.   Although these were mentioned in the pages of the documents I received, they were NOT among those supplied. These include the following:

	1)	Sign-in logs for the Oliver Street School for the relevant period, 1995
	2)	Engineering Drawings M1 and M2 by Behr Engineering, showing Site 			Plan, Boiler Room Layout, Details, etc.
	3)	Layout of Areas for Delivery and Storage of Materials, as designated and 			approved by the Owner, the Newark Board of Education (a.k.a. 			Newark Public Schools) for oil to gas conversion
	4)	Shop Drawings (by Contractor for oil to gas conversion)
	5)	As-Built Drawings (by Contractor for oil to gas conversion)
	6)	Accident Report (as required by OSHA and Contract)
	7)	Schedule of Progress of the Work
	8)	Certified Payroll Record (required by Contract regulations to ascertain 			compliance with Prevailing Wage and Affirmative Action 				requirements)

Should this information become available, or if I could gain entry to the Oliver Street School and observe the amount and size of piping there, and their runs to the meter room, etc., I would be pleased to render further clarification on the points discussed above, or on any other matters, that you may require.
