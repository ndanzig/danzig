Well, we are on the same page, here, I think. Nobody really knows what is going on, now, do they ? &nbsp;There are other local terrorist 'leaders' and Kings and Presidents of other Arab states, plus several meetings with President Clinton, &nbsp;we must not forget, who give Chm. Arafat an audience from time to time. &nbsp;Is he leading the Egyptians or they, him ? &nbsp;Is he following Hamas, or they, him ? &nbsp;Arafat is a figure on the world sage, having won the Nobel Peace Prize &nbsp;++ &nbsp;what a joke ! !<BR>
<BR>
He has been a terrorist leader, in fear for his life from enemies and from colleagues, for thirty, fourty years, a cagy man, he. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a private guard, personal Police, a He could have more control over 'ther street,' if he wanted. &nbsp;The proof ? &nbsp;His suporters ssay he <BR>
cannot control the street.' &nbsp;That proves, to me,. that he CAN.<BR>

I also point out tht the Arags have no monopoly of the word, "Palestine.' &nbsp;I collected money for trees 'In Palestine,' as a boy. &nbsp;&nbsp;When Ben Gurion took the name Israel, the other side gained the name Palestine buy default. &nbsp;sometimes I wroitemit Pjhilestine. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Arab Palestinians alsrady have two thirds of the Palestine madate area, called 'Jordan.' &nbsp;We are no fighting overe half od the remaining third. &nbsp;Why can;t the Jews have this one sixth of the areae ?<BR>
<BR>
As has been said ofterm "It is not easy to be a Jews.'<BR>
<BR>
What worries me now is the next battle: &nbsp;Show down with the United Nations in Durban, South Africa.<BR>
