Shalom, Nachum<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your kind words.&nbsp; Yes, I have a big bottle of Flaxseed Oil, 1000 Mg, and I take one a day.&nbsp; It's a darn big capsule !&nbsp; You are right about the liver.&nbsp; Funny thing, alcohol damages the liver, but I have never been drunk, never was a 'lush.'&nbsp; In fact, do you remember that when we lived together in Montclair, I would have a drink of red wine, usually sweet vermouth, every day on coming home ?&nbsp; One day, you told me that I was an alcoholic, which I strenuously denied.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
But then I remembered that one definition of an alcoholic was one who always denied that they were an alcoholic !<BR>
<BR>
Next day, I told you that another definition of an alcoholic was an inability to 'quit,' so I quit.&nbsp; {It was no problem, actually.. .. ]&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you remember that ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything passes through the liver, and it is an organ necessary for life.<BR>
<BR>
Monday I return to Montclair for two more tests.&nbsp; But then I plan to transfer my treatment for the liver to either NY University Hospital or Memorial Slaon-Ketttering, in New York.&nbsp; They are the experts.&nbsp; Fortunately, I signed on to the Head Doctor of the NYU Geriatric Unit as my physician several years back, so he could recommend a local Doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the Alternate Gabbi at T&amp;V is the Chief Administrator at Memorial:&nbsp; it is a busy place and he could help me there.<BR>
<BR>
I will try to be at Henry's when you visit him, my treatments permitting.<BR>
<BR>
Wishing you hearth, safety, prosperity and happiness.. ..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad<BR>

I hope everything works out ok.&nbsp; liver is not a good organ to mess with.<BR>
Have you tried the flax seed oil?&nbsp; I still think it is worth a try.<BR>
anyway, i wish you health and success with the procedures.<BR>
love, Nachum<BR>

&gt; Hi guys .. ..<BR>
&gt; &gt; My Crohn's is taking a strange turn:&nbsp; the CAT scan of my gut also revealed <BR>
&gt; some irregularities with my liver, of all things, and I am going back to <BR>
&gt; Mountainside Hospital today, for a biopsy.&nbsp; Susan will pick me up in the afternoon.<BR>
&gt; &gt; I'll let you know more when I know more, which could take several days.<BR>
&gt; &gt; Much love and wishes for health, safety, prosperity and happiness to you and <BR>
&gt; all the family,&nbsp; Dad<BR>
