<p>The long-term view described in the United States Federal High Performance
Computing and Communications (HPCC) Program indicates that all the Internet
networks will <a name=index572>be</a> absorbed into the National Research and
Education Network (NREN).
<p>The <i>High Performance Computing Act</i> of 1991 was signed into law in the
United States in December 1991. This bill allocated to the NREN approximately
US $100 million per year for the next five years.
<p>The NREN network is being developed to provide distributed computing
capability to research and educational institutions and to further advanced
research on very high-speed networks and applications.
<p>NREN has already scheduled the integration, coordinated by the NSF, of the
<a name=index573>DoD's</a> Defense Research Internet (DRI), NSFNet,
<a name=index574>NASA</a> (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)
Science Internet (NSI) <a name=index575>and</a> Department of Energy (DOE)
Energy Science Network (ESnet).
<p>The NREN program specifies a three-phase project coordinated by the DARPA to
increase data transmission speeds to 3 Gbps (gigabits per second) over the next
10 to 15 years. The program also includes the exploration of pricing mechanisms
for network services and applications and the initiation of a <i>structured
transition to commercial service</i>.
<p>In August 1992, under the NREN program, the DOE awarded a five-year, US $50
million contract for high-speed public switched Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM) services to Sprint Corporation. Under this contract, Sprint Corporation
will provide the DOE and NASA with ATM service at 45 Mbps (T3) speed.
Livermore, California was an initial test site, with more sites added in 1993.
Soon after, 15 DOE sites and 11 NASA sites were added to the production
network.
<p><a name=index579>At</a> this time, the evolution of the NREN program towards
high-speed networking is well advanced.  It would be useful at this stage to
describe the infrastructure of this developing high-speed network.
<p>The <i>Network Access Point (NAP)</i> is a critical interchange in the new
Internet architecture.  A number of organizations have been selected by the
National Science Foundation to operate the NAPs. Among these organizations are:
<ul>
<li>Sprint Corporation - New York/New Jersey
<li>Ameritech - Chicago
<li>PacBell - San Francisco/Bay Area
<li>MFSdatanet - Washington DC
</ul>
<p>The <i>Network Service Provider (NSP)</i> is a provider of Internet services
that qualifies to receive regional connectivity funding from NSF.  This means
that the NSP must connect to the three primary NAPs in California, Chicago and
New York (see above). Among these organizations are:
<ul>
<li>ANS (now owned by America Online)
<li>MCInet
<li>SprintLink
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are a number of <i>Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</i>
who do not qualify for the NSF regional connectivity funding. Among these
organizations are:
<ul>
<li>AlterNet
<li>Net99
<li>PSI
</ul>
<p>A <i>Routing Arbitor (RA)</i> is an NSF funded organization that provides
routing information at each NAP.  A Routing Arbiter Database is maintained at
<i>http://rrdb.merit.edu/grroverview.html on the World Wide Web</i>.
<p>The NAPs are currently providing high-speed services based upon ATM, frame
relay and FDDI to the NSPs and ISPs.  For more information on ATM, Frame Relay
and other high-speed networking technologies refer to the next section.
<p>More information on selected NAPs is available via the World Wide Web at
<i>http://rrdb.merit.edu/napsp3.html</i> and at
<i>http://rrdb.merit.edu/pacbell.html</i>.

<h3><a name="H44">1.4.1  Future - High-Speed Networking</a>
</h3>
<p>The future of NREN is influenced at least partially by advances in
high-speed networking technology. We summarize here several emerging
technologies and standards:
<ul>
<li><b>Frame relay</b> is a network interface protocol standard for interfacing
to a packet network (the approved CCITT I.233, Q.922, Q.933 and I.370 standards
and the approved ANSI T1.606, T1.618, T1.617 and T1.606 standards). It supports
variable sized frames, and hence is not recommended for carrying isochronous
traffic such as voice or video. (Note: voice must be transmitted with no more
than a 100 ms delay for acceptable quality.) A network can be easily
implemented on existing packet switching equipment using frame relay to gain
throughput improvements. Currently, the frame relay access speed is defined up
to T-1 (1.544 Mbps).
<li><b>Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB)</b> is a protocol designed to handle
both isochronous (constant rate, voice) traffic and data traffic over a very
high-speed optical link. The defined media and speed include:
<ul>
<li><i>Fiber connection</i> at 35 Mbps and 155 Mbps
<li><i>SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) connection</i> starting at 51,840
Mbps.
</ul>
This protocol was accepted as the standard (IEEE 802.6) for Metropolitan Area
Networks (MANs). It is the basis for a number of MANs. For example, the
Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS) is a MAN service that was introduced
in the U.S. in late 1992. Initially, SMDS operated (using copper connections)
at T-1 (1.544 Mbps) but subsequently at T-3 (45 Mbps).
<li><b>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)</b>, is a switching technology based on
53-byte fixed-length cell calls. It has very high-speed capabilities (defined
at both 155 Mbps and 622 Mbps) and is suitable for carrying voice, video and
data. Public networks are not expected to fully support ATM until the latter
half of the 1990s.
<li><b>Broadband-ISDN</b> is a newer, and not yet standardized, technology
offering even higher speed starting at OC-3 ("Optical Carrier level 3", 155.52
Mbps). It too is not expected to be available until 1995 at the earliest.
