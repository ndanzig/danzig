<h1><a name="routers">Chapter 3.  Routing Protocols</a>
</h1>
<p>One of the basic functions of IP is its ability to form connections between
different physical networks. This is due to the flexibility of IP to use almost
any physical network below it, and to the IP routing algorithm. A system which
does this is termed a <i>router</i>, although the older term <i>IP gateway</i>
is also used.
<p><b>Note:</b> In other sections of the book, we show the position of each
protocol in the layered model of the TCP/IP protocol stack. The routing
function is part of the internetwork layer, but the primary function of a
routing protocol is to <i>exchange</i> routing information with other routers,
and in this respect the protocols behave more like application protocols. The
routing protocols described here use all three approaches to data transport:
using UDP (for example RIP, described in <a href="3376c33.html#rip">Routing
Information Protocol (RIP)</a>), TCP (see BGP in
<a href="3376c34.html#bgp">Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</a>) and providing its
own transport layer on top of IP (see OSPF in <a href="3376c33.html#ospf">Open
Shortest Path First Protocol (OSPF) Version 2</a>). Therefore, we shall not
attempt to represent the position of these protocols in the protocol stack with
a diagram as we do with the other protocols.
