</h2>
<p><a name=index2009>LAN</a> switches are a new family of network building
blocks designed to increase the performance of departmental LANs and
distributed workgroups and to do so in a cost effective manner. LAN
segmentation, the separation of a population of LAN users into separate but
interconnected LAN segments, is a popular technique for improving LAN
performance by reducing contention. LAN switches offer a high performance, low
cost alternative method for interconnecting LAN segments. The IBM 8271 creates
multiple, high-speed, parallel paths among the connected Ethernet LAN segments
and devices. Since each of these parallel paths supports the full 10 Mbps
Ethernet bandwidth, total bandwidth of Ethernet networks segmented using the
IBM 8271 can be expanded to up to 400% of previous levels.
<p>The IBM 8271 supports full-duplex (bidirectional) communication with LAN
stations equipped with Full-Duplex Ethernet adapters, such as the IBM
EtherStreamer MC 32 Adapter. Full-duplex Ethernet connections can provide up to
twice the bandwidth of standard half-duplex connections, that is, up to 20 Mbps
on each of the switch ports (max. 8). A typical network would benefit from
using the IBM 8271 by placing each server on a dedicated full-duplex segment
and placing client workstations on shared segments using standard Ethernet
concentrators, such as the IBM 8222 6-Port 10BaseT Workgroup Hub.
<p>The IBM 8271 works like a normal Ethernet transparent multiport bridge and
supports the spanning tree algorithm.
<p>The SNMP agent has the following functionality:
<ul>
<li>MIB II
<li>8271 specific MIB
<li>SNMP GET/SET support
<li>Possible TRAPs:
<ul>
<li>Cold Start
<li>Warm Start
<li>Authentication Failure
<li>New Root (related to spanning tree)
<li>Topology Change (related to spanning tree)
</ul>
</ul>
<p>TFTP/BOOTP is provided for microcode or configuration download.
<p>For graphical management there is a Product Specific Module (PSM) available
for use with the application <i>NetView for Windows</i> which greatly
simplifies the management.
