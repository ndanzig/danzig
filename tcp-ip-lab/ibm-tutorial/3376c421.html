<h2><a name="whois">4.21  Whois Protocol</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1918>Whois</a> is a <i>draft standard protocol</i>. Its status
is <i>elective</i>. The current Whois specification can be found in <i>RFC 954
- NICNAME/WHOIS</i>.
<p>The Whois program is commonly used in the UNIX environment to connect to a
Whois server.  The purpose of the server is to provide directory type services.
 The original Whois server was set up so that the Network Information Center
could maintain a contact list for networks connected to the Internet.  However,
many sites now use Whois to provide local directory services.
<p>The Whois server is based upon TCP and uses well-known port 43. Requests and
replies exchanged between the client and server use NVT ASCII.
<p>The most widely used Whois server is maintained by the InterNIC and can be
reached at rs.internic.net.

<h4><a name="H770">4.21.0.1  Implementations</a>
</h4>
<p>AIX systems implement both the Whois client and server. Warp Internet
Connection provides the Whois client.
