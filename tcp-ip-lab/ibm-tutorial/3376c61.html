<p><a name=index2053>In</a> short, the Internet Gopher is a distributed
document search and retrieval system. It combines the best features of browsing
through collections of information and fully indexed databases. The protocol
and software follow a client/server model and permit users on a heterogeneous
mix of desktop systems to browse, search, and retrieve documents residing on
multiple distributed server machines.
<p>The Gopher protocol was developed at the University of Minnesota and is
available under RFC 1436. Its state is <i>informational</i>.
<p>The reason for developing Gopher was the need for a campus-wide information
system which enables anybody to be able to publish documents or information
even with a small desktop computer. Gopher client software presents users with
a hierarchy of items and directories much like a file system. In fact, the
Gopher interface is designed to resemble a file system since a file system is a
good model for locating documents and services. So if you are connected to a
Gopher server you get a list of different items, similar to the display of a
root directory from a PC. After selecting a menu item for example you get all
the items included, similar to a subdirectory and so forth. If you select a
file item for example the file is automatically transmitted and displayed at
the client. It is not necessary for the file to reside on the same Gopher
server where you got the information. A Gopher menu can include items from
different Gopher servers and the user gets automatically connected to the
server where the selected item points to and so on. The user does not know or
care that the items up for selection may reside on many different machines
anywhere on the Internet.
<p>A simple example:
<p>You would like to have a look at the menu of your canteen.
<ol>
<li>Start your Gopher client and connect to the main Gopher server
<li>Find an item which could include the menu and select it. For example:
Facilities
<li>The sub-items of Facilities are displayed
<li>One of the items may be "Today's Menu" which is a file residing on the
canteen's Gopher server
<li>If you select it your Gopher client automatically establishes a connection
to the server pointed to in the item, retrieves and displays the file
</ol>
The path to the file could be very complex and Gopher servers around the world
could be involved.
<p>To implement the above mentioned hierarchy the Gopher client needs some
information of the object type in order to display a file or a directory icon
for example. The Gopher type is coded as a single digit at the beginning of
each line. Following is a list of known Gopher types included in the RFC:
<ul>
<li>0 - Item is a file
<li>1 - Item is a directory
<li>2 - Item is a CSO (qi) phone-book server
<li>3 - Error
<li>4 - Item is a BinHexed Macintosh file
<li>5 - Item is a DOS binary archive of some sort
<li>6 - Item is a UNIX uuencoded file
<li>7 - Item is an Index-Search server
<li>8 - Item points to a text-based telnet session
<li>9 - Item is a binary file
<li>T - TN3270 connection
<li>s - Sound type. Data stream is a mulaw sound
<li>g - GIF type
<li>M - Item contains MIME data
<li>h - html type
<li>I - Image type
<li>i - "inline" text type
</ul>
<p>The following paragraphs describe the basic functionality of the Gopher
protocol.
<p>In essence, the Gopher protocol consists of a client connecting to a server
and sending the server a selector (a line of text, which may be empty) via a
TCP connection. The server responds with a block of text terminated with a
period on a line by itself, and closes the connection. No state is retained by
the server between transactions with a client. Let's assume a Gopher server
listens to port 70. The only configuration information the client software
retains is this server's name and port number (in this example that machine is
rawBits.micro.umn.edu and the port 70). In the example below the F character
denotes the TAB character.
<p>
<pre>
Client: {Opens connection to rawBits.micro.umn.edu at port 70}
Server: {Accepts connection but says nothing}

Client: &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; {Sends an empty line: Meaning "list what you have"}
Server: {Sends a series of lines, each ending with CR LF}

.                  {Period on a line by itself}
                   {Server closes connection}
</pre>
<p>The first character on each line describes the Gopher type as shown above.
The succeeding characters up to the tab build the display string to be shown to
the user for making a selection. The characters following the tab, up to the
next tab form a selector string that the client software must send to the
server to retrieve the document (or directory listing). In practice, the
selector string is often a path name or other file selector used by the server
to locate the item desired. The next two tab delimited fields denote the
domain-name of the host that has this document (or directory), and the port at
which to connect. A CR/LF denotes the end of the item. The client may present
the above data stream as follows:
<pre>

Microcomputer News &amp; Prices...
Courses, Schedules, Calendars...
Student-Staff Directories...
Departmental Publications...
</pre>
<p>In this case, directories are displayed with an ellipsis and files are
displayed without any. However, depending on the platform the client is written
for and the author's taste, item types could be denoted by other text tags or
by icons.
<p>In the example, line 1 describes a document the user will see as <i>"About
Internet Gopher"</i>. To retrieve this document, the client software must send
the retrieval string: <i>"Stuff:About us" to rawBits.micro.umn.edu at port
70</i>. If the client does this, the server will respond with the contents of
the document, terminated by a period on a line by itself. As you can see in
this example the user does not know or care that the items up for selection may
reside on many different machines anywhere on the Internet. The connection
between server and client only exists while the information is transferred.
After this the client may connect to a different server in order to get the
contents of a displayed directory.

<p><a name=index2054>As</a> interesting as it can be to explore "Gopherspace",
one day you might want to retrieve some information or a file from a Gopher
server. The problem is how to get the right servers providing the information
needed without calling up endless Gopher menus. Fortunately there is a way to
make even Gophers easier to use.
<p>This tool is called Veronica (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to
Computerized Archives) and does for Gopherspace what <i>Archie</i> does for FTP
sites.
<p><a name=index2055>Veronica</a> is a resource-discovery system providing
access to information resources held on most ( 99% + ) of the world's Gopher
servers. In addition to native Gopher data, Veronica includes references to
many resources provided by other types of information servers, such as WWW
servers, usenet archives, and telnet-accessible information services.
<p>Veronica queries are keyword-in-title searches. A simple query can be quite
powerful because a large number of information servers are included in the
index.
<p>Veronica is accessed through Gopher client software. A Veronica user submits
a query (via a Gopher client) which may contain boolean keyword expressions as
well as special Veronica directives. The result of a Veronica search is a
Gopher menu comprising information items whose titles contain the specified
keywords. The results menu may be browsed like any other Gopher menu.
<p>In January 1995, 5057 Gopher servers were indexed. The index also includes
items from approximately 5000 other servers, in cases where those servers are
referenced on Gopher menus. These other servers include 3905 WWW servers and
about 1000 TELNET-type services.
<p>On most Gopher servers you will find Veronica by selecting Other Gopher and
Information Services at the main menu and then Searching through Gopherspace
using Veronica. If your Gopher server does not provide the above items connect
directly to Veronica via gopher://veronica.scs.unr.edu.:70/11/veronica. There
you will also find additional information about Veronica.
