<h2><a name="snalink">5.6  SNALINK</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1949>Both</a> TCP/IP for VM and TCP/IP for MVS are implemented
with the SNAlink function. This function allows the use of an SNA backbone to
transfer TCP/IP protocols. A system equipped with TCP/IP and VTAM can be an
originator, destination, or router of data originating from such a system.
<p>In order to use this function of TCP/IP, you must have VTAM and TCP/IP
installed on each host to be connected via SNAlink. There are two types of
SNAlink implementations:
<ol>
<li>SNALINK, a VTAM application using the VTAM LU 0 protocol
<li>SNALNK62, a VTAM application using the VTAM LU 6.2 protocol
</ol>
<p>Both SNALINK and SNALNK62 run in a separate address space (in MVS) or
virtual machine (in VM) and are used to communicate between TCP/IP and VTAM.
(Please see <a href="3376c56.html#figsnalink">Figure - Principle of SNAlink
Function</a>.) Both communicate with TCP/IP using IUCV.
<p>SNALINK communicates via VTAM to its SNALINK partner on the remote host
using the LU 0 protocol.
<p>SNALNK62 communicates via VTAM to its SNALNK62 partner on the remote host
using the LU 6.2 protocol.
<p>For more details, please refer to the <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 3 Release 1 for
MVS: Customization and Administration Guide</i> and <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2
Release 3 for VM: Planning and Customization</i>.
<p>TCP/IP for OS/2 provides support for an SNAlink LU 6.2 connection in its
Extended Networking Kit.  For more information refer to <i>TCP/IP V2.0 for OS/2
Extended Networking Guide, SC31-7071</i>.
<p>Note that there is an Internet-Draft describing a method for the
transmission of IP over SNA LU6.2. For details, please see [Stevenson, Schwell
and Siddall] listed in <a href="3376ax1.html#relpubs">Bibliography</a>.

<p><a name=index1950>From</a> a workstation connected to a LAN using basic
TCP/IP functions, User A can access applications on Host A. In addition, User A
can <i>TELNET</i> or <i>FTP</i>, via the Host A (transparently using the
SNAlink function through a SNA backbone) to Host B.
