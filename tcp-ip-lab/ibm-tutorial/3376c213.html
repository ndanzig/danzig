<h2><a name="atm">2.13  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index962>ATM-based</a> networks are of increasing interest for both
local and wide area applications. There are already some products available to
build your physical ATM network. The ATM architecture is new and therefore
different from the standard LAN architectures. For this reason, changes are
required so that traditional LAN products will work in the ATM environment.  In
the case of TCP/IP the main change required is in the network interface to
provide support for ATM.
<p>There are several approaches already available, two of which are important
to the transport of TCP/IP traffic.  They are described in
<a href="3376c213.html#ipoatm">Classical IP over ATM</a> and
<a href="3376c213.html#lanemu">ATM LAN Emulation</a>.  They are also compared
in <a href="3376c213.html#cipvle">Classical IP over ATM versus LAN
Emulation</a>.

<h3><a name="atmarp">2.13.1  Address Resolution (ATMARP and InATMARP)</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index964>The</a> address resolution in an ATM logical IP subnet is
done by the ATM Address Resolution Protocol (ATMARP) based on RFC 826 and the
Inverse ATM Address Resolution Protocol (InATMARP) based on RFC 1293. ATMARP is
the same protocol as the ARP protocol with extensions needed to support ARP in
a unicast server ATM environment. InATMARP is the same protocol as the original
InARP protocol but applied to ATM networks. Use of these protocols differs
depending on whether PVCs or SVCs are used.
<p>Both ATMARP and InATMARP are defined in RFC 1577, which is a proposed
standard with a state of elective.
<p>The encapsulation of ATMARP and InATMARP requests/replies is described in
<a href="3376c213.html#ipoatm">Classical IP over ATM</a>.

<h4><a name="H237">2.13.1.1  InATMARP</a>
</h4>
<p>The ARP protocol is used to resolve a host's hardware address for a known IP
address. The InATMARP protocol is used to resolve a host's IP address for a
known hardware address. In a switched environment you first establish a VC
(Virtual Connection) of either PVC (Permanent Virtual Connection) or SVC
(Switched Virtual Connection) in order to communicate with another station.
Therefore you know the exact hardware address of the partner by administration
but the IP address is unknown. InATMARP provides dynamic address resolution.
InARP uses the same frame format as the standard ARP but defines two new
operation codes:
<ul>
<li>InARP request=8
<li>InARP reply=9
</ul>
Please see <a href="3376c28.html#arppg">ARP Packet Generation</a> for more
details.
<p>Basic InATMARP operates essentially the same as ARP with the exception that
InATMARP does not broadcast requests. This is because the hardware address of
the destination station is already known. A requesting station simply formats a
request by inserting its source hardware and IP address and the known target
hardware address. It then zero fills the target protocol address field and
sends it directly to the target station. For every InATMARP request, the
receiving station formats a reply using the source address from the request as
the target address of the reply. Both sides update their ARP tables. The
<i>hardware type</i> value for ATM is 19 decimal and the <i>EtherType</i> field
is set to 0x806, which indicates ARP according to RFC 1700.

<h4><a name="H238">2.13.1.2  Address Resolution in a PVC Environment</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index967>In</a> a PVC environment each station uses the InATMARP
protocol to determine the IP addresses of all other connected stations. The
resolution is done for those PVCs which are configured for LLC/SNAP
encapsulation. It is the responsibility of each IP station supporting PVCs to
revalidate ARP table entries as part of the aging process.

<h4><a name="H239">2.13.1.3  Address Resolution in an SVC Environment</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index968>SVCs</a> require support for ATMARP in the non-broadcast
environment of ATM. To meet this need, a single ATMARP server must be located
within the Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS) (see <a href="3376c213.html#lis">The
Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS)</a>). <a name=index969>This</a> server has
authoritative responsibility for resolving the ATMARP requests of all IP
members within the LIS. For an explanation of ATM terms please refer to
<a href="3376c213.html#ipoatm">Classical IP over ATM</a>.
<p>The server itself does not actively establish connections.  It depends on
the clients in the LIS to initiate the ATMARP registration procedure. An
individual client connects to the ATMARP server using a point-to-point VC. The
server, upon the completion of an ATM call/connection of a new VC specifying
LLC/SNAP encapsulation, will transmit an InATMARP request to determine the IP
address of the client. The InATMARP reply from the client contains the
information necessary for the ATMARP server to build its ATMARP table cache.
This table consists of:
<ul>
<li>IP address
<li>ATM address
<li>Timestamp
<li>Associated VC
</ul>
This information is used to generate replies to the ATMARP requests it
receives.
<p><b>Note:</b> The ATMARP server mechanism requires that each client be
administratively configured with the ATM address of the ATMARP server.

<h5><a name="H240">ARP table add/update algorithm:</a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>If the ATMARP server receives a new IP address in an InATMARP reply the IP
address is added to the ATMARP table.
<li>If the InATMARP IP address duplicates a table entry IP address and the
InATMARP ATM address does not match the table entry ATM address and there is an
open VC associated with that table entry, the InATMARP information is discarded
and no modifications to the table are made.
<li>When the server receives an ATMARP request over a VC, where the source IP
and ATM address match the association already in the ATMARP table and the ATM
address matches that associated with the VC, the server updates the timeout on
the source ATMARP table entry. For example, if the client is sending ATMARP
requests to the server over the same VC that it used to register its ATMARP
entry, the server notes that the client is still "alive" and updates the
timeout on the client's ATMARP table entry.
<li>When the server receives an ARP_REQUEST over a VC, it examines the source
information. If there is no IP address associated with the VC over which the
ATMARP request was received and if the source IP address is not associated with
any other connection, then the server adds this station to its ATMARP table.
This is not the normal way because, as mentioned above, it is the
responsibility of the client to register at the ATMARP server.
</ul>

<h5><a name="H241">ATMARP table aging</a>
</h5>
<p>ATMARP table entries are valid:
<ul>
<li>In clients for a maximum time of 15 minutes
<li>In servers for a minimum time of 20 minutes
</ul>
<p>Prior to aging an ATMARP table entry, the ATMARP server generates an
InARP_REQUEST on any open VC associated with that entry and decides what to do
according to the following rules:
<ul>
<li>If an InARP_REPLY is received, that table entry is updated and not deleted.
<li>If there is no open VC associated with the table entry, the entry is
deleted.
</ul>
Therefore, if the client does not maintain an open VC to the server, the client
must refresh its ATMARP information with the server at least once every 20
minutes. This is done by opening a VC to the server and exchanging the initial
InATMARP packets.
<p>The client handles the table updates according to the following:
<ul>
<li>When an ATMARP table entry ages, the ATMARP client invalidates this table
entry.
<li>If there is no open VC associated with the invalidated entry, that entry is
deleted.
<li>In the case of an invalidated entry and an open VC, the ATMARP client
revalidates the entry prior to  transmitting any non-address resolution traffic
on that VC. There are two possibilities:
<ul>
<li>In the case of a PVC, the client validates the entry by transmitting an
InARP_REQUEST and updating the entry on receipt of an InARP_REPLY.
<li>In the case of an SVC, the client validates the entry by transmitting an
ARP_REQUEST to the ATMARP server and updating the entry on receipt of an
ARP_REPLY.
</ul>
<li>If a VC with an associated invalidated ATMARP table entry is closed, that
table entry is removed.
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, every ATM IP client which uses SVCs must know its ATMARP
server's ATM address for the particular LIS. This address must be named at
every client during customization. There is at present no "well-known" ATMARP
server address defined.

<h3><a name="ipoatm">2.13.2  Classical IP over ATM</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index970>The</a> definitions for implementations of classical IP
over ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) are described in RFC 1577 which is a
proposed standard with a status of elective according to RFC 1720 (STD 1). This
RFC considers only the application of ATM as a direct replacement for the
"wires", local LAN segments connecting IP end-stations ("members") and routers
operating in the  "classical" LAN-based paradigm. Issues raised by MAC level
bridging and LAN emulation are not covered.
<p>For ATM Forum's method of providing ATM migration please see
<a href="3376c213.html#lanemu">ATM LAN Emulation</a>.
<p>Initial deployment of ATM provides a LAN segment replacement for:
<ul>
<li>Ethernets, token-rings or FDDI networks
<li>Local-area backbones between existing (non-ATM) LANs
<li>Dedicated circuits of Frame Relay PVCs between IP routers
</ul>
This RFC also describes extensions to the ARP protocol (RFC 826) in order to
work over ATM. This is discussed separately in
<a href="3376c213.html#atmarp">Address Resolution (ATMARP and InATMARP)</a>.
<p>First some ATM basics:
<dl>
<dt>
Cells
<dd><a name=index974>All</a> information (voice, image, video, data , etc.) is
transported through the network in very short (48 data bytes plus a 5-byte
header) blocks called "cells".
<dt>
Routing
<dd>Information flow is along paths (called "virtual channels") set up as a
series of pointers through the network. The cell header contains an identifier
that links the cell to the correct path that it will take towards its
destination.
<p>Cells on a particular virtual channel always follow the same path through
the network and are delivered to the destination in the same order in which
they were received.
<dt>
Hardware-Based Switching
<dd>ATM is designed so that simple hardware-based logic elements may be
employed at each node to perform the switching. On a link of 1 Gbps a new cell
arrives and a cell is transmitted every .43 microseconds. There is not a lot of
time to decide what to do with an arriving packet.
<dt>
Virtual Connection VC
<dd><a name=index976>ATM</a> provides a Virtual Connection switched
environment. VC setup may be done on either a Permanent Virtual Connection
(PVC) or a dynamic Switched Virtual Connection (SVC) basis. SVC call management
is performed via implementations of the Q.93B protocol.
<dt>
End-User-Interface
<dd>The only way for a higher layer protocol to communicate across an ATM
network is over the ATM AAL (ATM Adaptation Layer). The function of this layer
is to perform the mapping of PDUs (Protocol Data Units) into the information
field of the ATM cell and vice versa. There are four different AAL types
defined, AAL1, AAL2, AAL3/4 and AAL5. These AALs offer different services for
higher layer protocols. Here are the characteristics of AAL5 which is used for
TCP/IP:
<ul>
<li>Message mode and streaming mode
<li>Assured delivery
<li>Non-assured delivery (used by TCP/IP)
<li>Blocking and segmentation of data
<li>Multipoint operation
</ul>
AAL5 provides the same functions as a LAN at the MAC (Medium Access Control)
layer. The AAL type is known by the VC endpoints via the cell setup mechanism
and is not carried in the ATM cell header. For PVCs the AAL type is
administratively configured at the endpoints when the Connection (circuit) is
set up. For SVCs, the AAL type is communicated along the VC path via Q.93B as
part of call setup establishment and the endpoints use the signaled information
for configuration. ATM switches generally do not care about the AAL type of
VCs. The AAL5 format specifies a packet format with a maximum size of 64KB - 1
byte of user data. The "primitives" which the higher layer protocol has to use
in order to interface with the AAL layer (at the AAL service access point -
SAP) are rigorously defined. When a high-layer protocol sends data, that data
is processed first by the adaptation layer, then by the ATM layer and then the
physical layer takes over to send the data to the ATM network. The cells are
transported by the network and then received on the other side first by the
physical layer, then processed by the ATM layer and then by the receiving AAL.
When all this is complete, the information (data) is passed to the receiving
higher layer protocol. The total function performed by the ATM network has been
the non-assured transport (it might have lost some) of  information from one
side to the other. Looked at from a traditional data processing viewpoint all
the ATM network has done is to replace a physical link connection with another
kind of physical connection - all  the "higher layer" network functions must
still be performed (for example IEEE 802.2).
<dt>
Addressing
<dd>An ATM Forum endpoint address is either encoded as a 20-byte OSI NSAP-based
address (used for private network addressing, three formats possible) or is an
E.164 Public UNI address (telephone number style address used for public ATM
networks). <a href=3376footnotes.html#footnote5>(5)</a>
<dt>
Broadcast, Multicast
<dd>There are currently no broadcast functions similar to LANs provided. But
there is a multicast function available. The ATM term for multicast is
"point-to-multipoint connection".
</dl>

<h4><a name="lis">2.13.2.1  The Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS)</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index978>The</a> term LIS was introduced to map the logical IP
structure to the ATM network. In the LIS scenario, each separate administrative
entity configures its hosts and routers within a closed logical IP subnetwork
(same IP network/subnet number and address mask). Each LIS operates and
communicates independently of other LISs on the same ATM network. Hosts that
are connected to an ATM network communicate directly to other hosts within the
same LIS. This implies that all members of a LIS are able to communicate via
ATM with all other members in the same LIS (VC topology is fully meshed).
Communication to hosts outside of the local LIS is provided via an IP router.
This router is an ATM endpoint attached to the ATM network that is configured
as a member of one or more LISs. This configuration may result in a number of
separate LISs operating over the same ATM network. Hosts of differing IP
subnets must communicate via an intermediate IP router even though it may be
possible to open a direct VC between the two IP members over the ATM network.

<h4><a name="H245">2.13.2.2  Multiprotocol Encapsulation</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index980>If</a> you want to use more than one type of network
protocol (IP, IPX, etc.) concurrently over a physical network, you need a
method of multiplexing the different protocols. This can be done in the case of
ATM either by VC-based multiplexing or LLC encapsulation. If you choose
VC-based multiplexing you have to have a VC for each different protocol between
the two hosts. The LLC encapsulation provides the multiplexing function at the
LLC layer and therefore needs only one VC. TCP/IP uses, according to RFC 1577
and 1483, the second method because this kind of multiplexing was already
defined in RFC 1042 for all other LAN types such as Ethernet, token-ring and
FDDI. With this definition IP uses ATM simply as a LAN replacement. All the
other benefits ATM has to offer, such as transportation of isochronous traffic
etc., are not used. There is an IETF working group with the mission of
improving the IP implementation and to interface with the ATM Forum in order to
represent the interests of the Internet community for future standards.
<p>To be exact, the TCP/IP PDU is encapsulated in an IEEE 802.2 LLC header
followed by an IEEE 802.1a SNAP header (SubNetwork Attachment Point) and
carried within the payload field of an AAL5 CPCS-PDU (Common Part Convergence
Sublayer). The AAL5 CPCS-PDU format is shown in
<a href="3376c213.html#figcpcspdu">Figure - AAL5 CPCS-PDU Format</a>.

CPCS-PDU Payload
<dd>The CPCS-PDU payload is shown in
<a href="3376c213.html#figippdu">Figure - CPCS-PDU Payload Format for IP
PDUs</a>.
<dt>
Pad
<dd>The Pad field pads out the CDCS-PDU to fit exactly into the the ATM cells.
<dt>
CPCS-UU
<dd>The CPCS-UU (User-to-User identification) field is used to transparently
transfer CPCS user-to-user information. This field has no function for the
encapsulation and can be set to any value.
<dt>
CPI
<dd>The CPI (Common Part Indicator) field aligns the CPCS-PDU trailer with 64
bits.
<dt>
Length
<dd>The Length field indicates the length, in bytes, of the Payload field. The
maximum value is 65535 which is 64KB - 1.
<dt>
CRC
<dd>The CRC field protects the entire CPCS-PDU except the CRC field itself.

<img src="3376f62.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: CPCS-PDU Payload Format for IP PDUs</i><br><br>
<dl>
<dt>
IP PDU
<dd>Normal IP datagram starting with the IP header.
<dt>
LLC
<dd>3-byte LLC header with the format DSAP-SSAP-Ctrl. For IP data it is set to
0xAA-AA-03 to indicate the presence of a SNAP header. The Ctrl field always has
the value 0x03 specifying Unnumbered Information Command PDU.
<dt>
OUI
<dd>The 3-byte OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) identifies an
organization which administers the meaning of the following 2-byte Protocol
Identifier (PID). To specify an EtherType in PID the OUI has to be set to
0x00-00-00.
<dt>
PID
<dd>The Protocol Identifier (PID) field specifies the protocol type of the
following PDU. For IP datagrams the assigned EtherType or PID is 0x08-00.
</dl>
<p>The default MTU size for IP members in an ATM network is discussed in RFC
1626 and defined to be 9180 bytes. The LLC/SNAP header is 8 bytes; therefore,
the default ATM AAL5 PDU size is 9188 bytes. The possible values can be between
zero and 65535. You are allowed to change the MTU size but then all members of
a LIS must be changed as well in order to have the same value. RFC 1755
recommends that all implementations should support MTU sizes up to and
including 64KB.
<p>The address resolution in an ATM network is defined as an extension of the
ARP protocol and is described in <a href="3376c213.html#atmarp">Address
Resolution (ATMARP and InATMARP)</a>.
<p>There is no mapping from IP broadcast or multicast addresses to ATM
"broadcast" or multicast addresses available. But there are no restrictions for
transmitting or receiving IP datagrams specifying any of the four standard IP
broadcast address forms as described in RFC 1122. Members, upon receiving an IP
broadcast or IP subnet broadcast for their LIS, must process the packet as if
addressed to that station.

<h4><a name="H248">2.13.2.3  Implementations</a>
</h4>
<p>The following implementations of classical IP over ATM according to RFC 1577
are available at the time of writing:
<ul>
<li>IBM AIX/6000
<li>IBM 8260, Switch/Control Point Module, for SNMP over ATM
<li>IBM Turboways 8282 ATM Workgroup Concentrator, for SNMP over ATM
</ul>

<h3><a name="lanemu">2.13.3  ATM LAN Emulation</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index982>Another</a> approach to provide a migration path to a
native ATM network is ATM LAN emulation. ATM LAN emulation is still under
construction by ATM Forum working groups. For the IETF approach please see
<a href="3376c213.html#ipoatm">Classical IP over ATM</a>. There is no ATM Forum
implementation agreement available covering virtual LANs over ATM but there are
some basic agreements on the different  proposals made to the ATM Forum. The
descriptions below are based on the IBM proposals.
<p>The concept of ATM LAN emulation is to construct a system such that the
workstation application software ``thinks'' it is a member of a real
shared-medium LAN, such as a token-ring for example. This method maximizes the
reuse of existing LAN software and significantly reduces the cost of migration
to ATM. In PC LAN environments for example the LAN emulation layer could be
implemented under the NDIS/ODI-type interface. With such an implementation all
the higher layer protocols, such as IP, IPX, NetBIOS and SNA for example, could
be run over ATM networks without any change.
<p>Refer to <a href="3376c213.html#figatmlani">Figure - Ethernet and Token-ring
LAN Emulation</a> for the implementation of token-ring and Ethernet.
<br><br><a name=figatmlani>
<img src="atm1lemt.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: Ethernet and Token-ring LAN Emulation</i><br><br>

<h4><a name="H251">2.13.3.1  LAN Emulation Layer (Workstation Software)</a>
</h4>
<p>Each workstation that performs the LE function needs to have software to
provide the LE service. This software is called the LAN emulation layer (LE
layer). It provides the interface to existing protocol support (such as IP,
IPX, IEEE 802.2 LLC, NetBIOS, etc.) and emulates the functions of a real
shared-medium LAN. This means that no changes are needed to existing LAN
application software to use ATM services. The LE layer interfaces to the ATM
network through a hardware ATM adapter.
<p>The primary function of the LE layer is to transfer encapsulated LAN frames
(arriving from higher layers) to their destination either directly (over a
``direct VC'') or through the LE server. This is done by using AAL5 services
provided by ATM.
<p>Each LE layer has one or more LAN addresses as well as an ATM address.
<p>A separate instance (logical copy or LE client) of the LE layer is needed in
each workstation for each different LAN or type of LAN to be supported. For
example, if both token-ring and Ethernet LAN types are to be emulated, then you
need two LE layers. In fact they will probably just be different threads within
the same copy of the same code but they are logically separate LE layers.
Separate LE layers would also be used if one workstation needed to be part of
two different emulated token-ring LANs. Each separate LE layer needs a
different MAC address but can share the same physical ATM connection (adapter).

<h4><a name="H252">2.13.3.2  LAN Emulation Server</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index984>The</a> basic function of the LE server is to provide
directory, multicast and address resolution services to the LE layers in the
workstations. It also provides a connectionless data transfer service to the LE
layers in the workstations if needed.
<p>Each emulated LAN must have an LE server. It would be possible to have
multiple LE servers sharing the same hardware and code (via multithreading) but
the LE servers are logically separate entities. As for the LE layers, an
emulated token-ring LAN cannot have members that are emulating an Ethernet LAN.
Thus an instance of an LE server is dedicated to a single type of LAN
emulation. The LE server may be physically internal to the ATM network or
provided in an external device, but logically it is always an external function
which simply uses the services provided by ATM to do its job.

<h4><a name="H253">2.13.3.3  Default VCs</a>
</h4>
<p>A default VC is a connection between an LE layer in a workstation and the LE
server. These connections may be permanent or switched.
<p>All LE control messages are carried between the LE layer and the LE server
on the default VC. Encapsulated data frames may also be sent on the default VC.
<p>The presence of the LE server and the default VCs is necessary for the LE
function to be performed.

<h4><a name="H254">2.13.3.4  Direct VCs</a>
</h4>
<p>Direct VCs are connections between LE layers in the end systems. They are
always switched and set up on demand. If the ATM network does not support
switched connections then you cannot have direct VCs and all the data must be
sent through the LE server on default VCs. If there is no direct VC available
for any reason then data transfer must take place through the LE server (there
is no other way).
<p>Direct VCs are set up on request by an LE layer (the server cannot set them
up as there is no third party call setup function in ATM). The ATM address of a
destination LE layer is provided to a requesting LE layer by the LE server.
Direct VCs stay in place until one of the partner LE layers decides to end the
connection (because there is no more data).

<h4><a name="H255">2.13.3.5  Initialization</a>
</h4>
<p>During initialization the LE layer (workstation) establishes the default VC
with the LE server. It also discovers its own ATM address - this is needed if
it is to later set up direct VCs.

<h4><a name="H256">2.13.3.6  Registration</a>
</h4>
<p>In this phase the LE layer (workstation) registers its MAC addresses with
the LE server. Other things like filtering requirements (optional) may be
provided.

<h4><a name="H257">2.13.3.7  Management and Resolution</a>
</h4>
<p>This is the method used by ATM end stations to set up direct VCs  with other
end stations (LE layers). This function includes mechanisms for learning the
ATM address of a target station, mapping the MAC address to an ATM address,
storing the mapping in a table and managing the table.
<p>For the server this function provides the means for supporting the use of
direct VCs by end stations. This includes a mechanism for mapping the MAC
address of an end system to its ATM address, storing the information and
providing it to a requesting end station.
<p>This structure maintains full LAN function and can support most higher layer
LAN protocols. Reliance on the server for data transfer is minimized by using
switched VCs for the transport of most bulk data.

<h4><a name="H258">2.13.3.8  Implementations</a>
</h4>
<p>LAN emulation is provided by the following IBM products:
<ul>
<li>IBM 8260, Switch/Control Point Module, for SNMP over ATM.
<li>IBM 8281 LAN Bridge to connect Ethernet or token-ring LANs to native
attached ATM stations running LAN Emulation.
<li>IBM Turboways 25/100 ATM Adapter for ISA/MCA PCs. Token-ring LAN Emulation
software for DOS/Windows is provided with the adapter. ATM LAN Emulation Server
runs on a Novell NetWare server 3.12 or higher and requires a dedicated
Turboways 100 ATM adapter.
<li>IBM 8282 Workgroup Concentrator to build an ATM network.
</ul>
<p>LAN Emulation software for OS/2, Ethernet and ATM Forum LAN Emulation
Specification support is expected to follow during 1995.

<h3><a name="cipvle">2.13.4  Classical IP over ATM versus LAN Emulation</a>
</h3>
<p>These two approaches to providing an easier way to migrate to ATM were made
with different goals in mind.
<p>Classical IP over ATM defines an encapsulation and address resolution
method. The definitions are made for IP only and not for use with other
protocols. So if you have applications requiring other protocol stacks (such as
IPX or SNA for example) then IP over ATM will not provide a complete solution.
On the other hand if you only have TCP or UDP-based applications then this
might be the better solution, since this specialized adaptation of the IP
protocol to the ATM architecture is likely to produce less overhead than a more
global solution and therefore be more efficient. Another advantage of this
implementation is the use of some ATM-specific functions, such as large MTU
sizes, etc.
<p>The major goal of the ATM Forum's approach is to run layer 3 and higher
protocols unchanged over the ATM network. This means that existing protocols,
such as TCP/IP, IPX, NetBIOS and SNA for example, and their applications can
use the benefits of the fast ATM network without any changes. The mapping for
all protocols is already defined. The LAN emulation layer provides all the
services of a classic LAN; thus, the upper layer does not know of the existence
of ATM. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage because the knowledge of
the underlying network could be used to provide a more effective
implementation.
<p>In the near future both approaches will be used depending on the particular
requirements.  Over time, when the mapping of applications to ATM is fully
