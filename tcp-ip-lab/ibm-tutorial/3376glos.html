network carriers onto a single cable.  This is usually done using frequency
division multiplexing.  Broadband technology allows several networks to coexist
on one single cable; traffic from one network does not interfere with traffic
from another since the "conversations" happen on different frequencies in the

RFC
<dd>Request For Comments.  The document series, begun in 1969, which describes
the Internet suite of protocols and related experiments. Not all (in fact very
few) RFCs describe Internet standards, but all Internet standards are written
up as RFCs.
<dt>
RFS
<dd>Remote File System.  A distributed file system, similar to NFS, developed
by AT&amp;T and distributed with their UNIX System V operating system.  See
NFS.
<dt>
RIP
<dd>Routing Information Protocol.  An Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) supplied
with Berkeley UNIX.
<dt>
RIPE
<dd>Reseaux IP Europeens.  European continental TCP/IP network operated by
EUnet.  See EUnet.
<dt>
rlogin
<dd>A service offered by Berkeley UNIX which allows users of one machine to log
into other UNIX systems (for which they are authorized) and interact as if
their terminals were connected directly.  Similar to TELNET.
<dt>
ROSE
<dd>Remote Operations Service Element.  A lightweight RPC protocol, used in OSI
Message Handling, Directory, and Network Management application protocols.
<dt>
router
<dd>A system responsible for making decisions about which of several paths
network (or Internet) traffic will follow.  To do this it uses a routing
protocol to gain information about the network, and algorithms to choose the
best route based on several criteria known as "routing metrics."  In OSI
terminology, a router is a network layer intermediate system.  See gateway,
bridge and repeater.
<dt>
RPC
<dd>Remote Procedure Call.  An easy and popular paradigm for implementing the
client/server model of distributed computing.  A request is sent to a remote
system to execute a designated procedure, using arguments supplied, and the
result returned to the caller. There are many variations and subtleties,
resulting in a variety of different RPC protocols.
<dt>
RTSE
<dd>Reliable Transfer Service Element.  A lightweight OSI application service
used above X.25 networks to handshake application PDUs across the Session
Service and TP0.  Not needed with TP4, and not recommended for use in the U.S.
except when talking to X.400 ADMDs.
</dl><h2>S</h2></dl>
<dt>
SAP
<dd>Service Access Point.  The point at which the services of an OSI layer are
made available to the next higher layer.  The SAP is named according to the
layer providing the services: for example, transport services are provided at a
Transport SAP (TSAP) at the top of the transport layer.
<dt>
selector
<dd>The identifier used by an OSI entity to distinguish among multiple SAPs at
which it provides services to the layer above.  See port.
<dt>
session layer
<dd>The OSI layer that provides means for dialogue control between end systems.
<dt>
SGMP
<dd>Simple Gateway Management Protocol.  The predecessor to SNMP. See SNMP.
<dt>
SLIP
<dd>Serial Line IP.  An Internet protocol used to run IP over serial lines such
as telephone circuits or RS-232 cables interconnecting two systems.  SLIP is
now being replaced by PPP.  See PPP.
<dt>
SMDS
<dd>Switched Multimegabit Data Service.  An emerging high-speed networking
technology to be offered by the telephone companies in the U.S.
<dt>
SMI
<dd>Structure of Management Information.  The rules used to define the objects
that can be accessed via a network management protocol. See MIB.
<dt>
SMTP
<dd>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.  The Internet electronic mail protocol.
Defined in RFC 821, with associated message format descriptions in RFC 822.
<dt>
SNA
<dd>Systems Network Architecture.  IBM's proprietary network architecture.
<dt>
SNMP
<dd>Simple Network Management Protocol.  The network management protocol of
choice for TCP/IP-based internets.
<dt>
SPAG
<dd>Standards Promotion and Application Group.  A group of European OSI
manufacturers which chooses option subsets and publishes these in a "Guide to
the Use of Standards" (GUS).
<dt>
SQL
<dd>Structured Query Language.  The international standard language for
defining and accessing relational databases.
<dt>
subnet mask
<dd>See address mask.
<dt>
subnetwork
<dd>A collection of OSI end systems and intermediate systems under the control
of a single administrative domain and utilizing a single network access
protocol.  Examples: private X.25 networks, collection of bridged LANs.
</dl><h2>T</h2></dl>
<dt>
TCP
<dd>Transmission Control Protocol.  The major transport protocol in the
Internet suite of protocols providing reliable, connection-oriented,
full-duplex streams.  Uses IP for delivery.  See TP4.
<dt>
Telnet
<dd>The virtual terminal protocol in the Internet suite of protocols.  Allows
users of one host to log into a remote host and interact as normal terminal
users of that host.
<dt>
three-way-handshake
<dd>The process whereby two protocol entities synchronize during connection
establishment.
<dt>
TP0
<dd>OSI Transport Protocol Class 0 (Simple Class).  This is the simplest OSI
Transport Protocol, useful only on top of an X.25 network (or other network
that does not lose or damage data).
<dt>
TP4
<dd>OSI Transport Protocol Class 4 (Error Detection and Recovery Class).  This
is the most powerful OSI Transport protocol, useful on top of any type of
network.  TP4 is the OSI equivalent to TCP.
<dt>
transceiver
<dd>Transmitter-receiver.  The physical device that connects a host interface
to a local area network, such as Ethernet.  Ethernet transceivers contain
electronics that apply signals to the cable and sense collisions.
<dt>
transport layer
<dd>The OSI layer that is responsible for reliable end-to-end data transfer
between end systems.
</dl><h2>U</h2></dl>
<dt>
UA
<dd>User Agent. An OSI application process that represents a human user or
organization in the X.400 Message Handling System.  Creates, submits, and takes
delivery of messages on the user's behalf.
<dt>
UDP
<dd>User Datagram Protocol.  A transport protocol in the Internet suite of
protocols.  UDP, like TCP, uses IP for delivery; however, unlike TCP, UDP
provides for exchange of datagrams without acknowledgements or guaranteed
delivery.  See CLTP.
<dt>
UUCP
<dd>UNIX to UNIX Copy Program.  A protocol used for communication between
consenting UNIX systems.
</dl><h2>V</h2></dl>
<dt>
Veronica
<dd>Search tool for the gopher environment.  See gopher.
</dl><h2>W</h2></dl>
<dt>
WWW
<dd>World Wide Web.  A global hypertext system that supports multimedia
communications on the Internet.
</dl><h2>X</h2></dl>
<dt>
XDR
<dd>eXternal Data Representation.  A standard for machine-independent data
structures developed by SUN Microsystems.  Similar to ASN.1.
<dt>
X/Open
<dd>A group of computer manufacturers that promotes the development of portable
applications based on UNIX.  They publish a document called the <i>X/Open
Portability Guide</i>.
<dt>
X Recommendations
<dd>The CCITT documents that describe data communication network standards.
Well-known ones include: X.25 Packet Switching standard, X.400 Message Handling
System, and X.500 Directory Services.
<dt>
The X Window System
<dd>A popular window system developed by MIT and implemented on a number of
workstations.
