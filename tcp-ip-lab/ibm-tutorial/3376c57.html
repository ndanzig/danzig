<h2><a name="i8022">5.7  FDDI</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1951>The</a> FDDI specifications define a family of standards
for 100 Mbps fiber optic LANs that provides the physical layer and media access
control sublayer of the data link layer as defined by the ISO/OSI Model.
<p><a name=index1953>IP-FDDI</a> is a <i>draft standard protocol</i>. Its
status is <i>elective</i>. It defines the encapsulating of IP datagrams and ARP
requests and replies in FDDI frames.
<a href="3376c57.html#figipfddi">Figure - IP and ARP over FDDI</a> shows the
related protocol layers.
<p>It is defined in <i>RFC 1188 - A Proposed Standard for the Transmission of
IP Datagrams over FDDI Networks</i> <a name=index1954>for</a> single MAC
stations. Operation on dual MAC stations will be described in a forthcoming
RFC.
<p>RFC 1188 states that all frames are transmitted in standard
<a name=index1956>IEEE</a> 802.2 LLC Type 1 Unnumbered Information format, with
the DSAP and SSAP fields of the 802.2 header set to the assigned
<a name=index1957>global</a> SAP value for SNAP (decimal 170). The 24-bit
Organization Code in the SNAP header is set to zero, and the remaining 16 bits
are the EtherType from Assigned Numbers (see RFC 1340), that is:
<ul>
<li>2048 for IP
<li>2054 for ARP
</ul>
<p>The mapping of 32-bit Internet addresses to 48-bit FDDI addresses is done
via the ARP dynamic discovery procedure. The broadcast Internet addresses
(whose &lt;host address&gt; is set to all ones) are mapped to the broadcast
FDDI address (all ones).
<p>IP datagrams are transmitted as series of 8-bit bytes using the usual TCP/IP
transmission order called "big-endian" or "network byte order".
<p>The FDDI MAC specification (<i>ISO 9314-2 - ISO, Fiber Distributed Data
Interface - Media Access Control</i>) defines a maximum frame size of 4500
bytes for all frame fields. After taking the LLC/SNAP header into account, and
to allow future extensions to the MAC <a name=index1958>header</a> and frame
status fields, the MTU of FDDI networks is set to 4532 bytes.
<p>Please refer to <i>LAN Concepts and Products,</i> GG24-3178 for more details
on the FDDI architecture.

<h4><a name="H818">5.7.0.1  Implementations</a>
</h4>
<p>TCP/IP for MVS, TCP/IP for VM, and TCP/IP for AIX/ESA all support the FDDI
Controller.
<p>AIX/6000 supports FDDI connectivity through the RISC System/6000 Fiber
Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) and the RISC System/6000 Serial Optical
Channel Converter (SOCC) adapters.
