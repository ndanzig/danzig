<h1><a name="iaccess">Chapter 6.  Internet Access</a>
</h1>
<p><a name=index2046>In</a> the past the Internet was reserved for researchers,
scientists and academics to exchange or provide world-wide information. The
major tools for communication across the network were E-Mail, FTP, and TELNET.
Internet access for private individuals was very difficult and its use for
commercial purposes was strictly forbidden because the Internet was largely
funded by the government. The capability of the hardware (non-programmable
terminals), the modem speeds and the bandwidth of the network made graphical
presentation of information impossible.
<p>The Internet gradually became more open to the wider world, as the Internet
access provider companies offered Internet access that was affordable to
private individuals. This process was driven by a fall in technology costs,
including telecommunications services, hence making it more economical to
access the Internet. Associated with this change has been the need to find
effective navigation tools for exploring the Internet. The goals for an
Internet front end system are:
<ul>
<li>Ease of installation and use
<li>Navigation support
<li>Provide access to complex Internet technologies like TELNET, Gopher,
USENET, FTP, mail, etc.
<li>Operating system independent
<li>Simple access to text, audio, video and graphics (one-button press only)
</ul>
<p>There is a variety of Internet navigators available. Each tool has
particular strengths for certain types of applications. Here are the most
popular tools with a brief description:
<ul>
<li>WAIS Wide Area Information Services
<p><a name=index2047>Well</a> suited to index and search large databases.
Widely used by librarians and researchers.
<li>Gopher
<p><a name=index2048>Tool</a> to provide menu access to existing information.
Many organizations use this tool instead of an anonymous FTP site. See
<a href="3376c61.html#gopher">Gopher</a>.
<li>Veronica:
<p><a name=index2049>Search</a> tool for the Gopher environment. See
<a href="3376c61.html#veronic">Veronica</a>.
<li>Archie
<p><a name=index2050>One</a> of the first navigators, used to search files on
FTP sites.
<li>WWW World Wide Web
<p><a name=index2051>Provides</a> an index of existing information like Gopher
but supports hypertext and hypermedia to create new documents containing text,
audio, video and graphics. WWW has become very popular. See
<a href="3376c62.html#www">World Wide Web</a>.
</ul>
<p>But on the other hand what about security?  All these new possibilities to
retrieve or provide information on the Internet imply that your network has
access to the world-wide Internet and all others have access to your network.
What you want is to connect to the Internet so that you can use all these new
services to find and retrieve all the wonderful new information out there, but
you don't want network "hackers" to be able to access your files.
<p>IBM offers the product <i>IBM NetSP Secured Network Gateway</i> to build a
secured network access for your network. The <i>firewall</i> concepts are
described later in this chapter.
