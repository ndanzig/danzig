<br><i>Figure: TELNET</i> - Remote Login Protocol.<br><br>
<p><a name=index1383>TELNET</a> is a <i>standard protocol</i> with STD number
8. <a name=index1384>Its</a> status is <i>recommended</i>. It is described in
<i>RFC 854 - TELNET Protocol Specifications</i> and <i>RFC 855 - TELNET Option
Specifications</i>.
<p>The TELNET protocol provides a standardized interface, through which a
program on one host (the TELNET client) may access the resources of another
host (the TELNET server) as though the client were a local terminal connected
to the server.
<p>For example, a user on a workstation on a LAN may connect to a host attached
to the LAN as though the workstation were a terminal attached directly to the
host. Of course, TELNET may be used across WANs as well as LANs.

<br><i>Figure: Remote Login using TELNET</i> - TELNET allows the LAN-attached
user to log in the same way as the local terminal user.<br><br>
<p>Most TELNET implementations do not provide you with graphics capabilities.

<h3><a name="H406">4.2.1  TELNET Operation</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1385>TELNET</a> protocol is based on three ideas:
<ul>
<li>The <i>Network Virtual Terminal (NVT)</i> concept. <a name=index1386>An</a>
NVT is an imaginary device having a basic structure common to a wide range of
real terminals. Each host maps its own terminal characteristics to those of an
NVT, and assumes that every other host will do the same.
<li>A symmetric view of terminals and processes
<li>Negotiation of terminal options. The principle of negotiated options is
used by the TELNET protocol, because many hosts wish to provide additional
services, beyond those available with the NVT. Various options may be
negotiated. Server and client use a set of conventions to establish the
operational characteristics of their TELNET connection via the ``DO, DON'T,
WILL, WON'T'' mechanism discussed later in this chapter.
</ul>
<p>The two hosts begin by verifying their mutual understanding. Once this
initial negotiation is complete, they are capable of working on the minimum
level implemented by the NVT. After this minimum understanding is achieved,
they can negotiate additional options to extend the capabilities of the NVT to
reflect more accurately the capabilities of the real hardware in use. Because
of the symmetric model used by TELNET, both the host and the client may propose
additional options to be used.
<br><br><a name=fignvt>
<img src="3376f98.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: The Symmetric TELNET Model</i> - The negotiations start on the
NVT basis.<br><br>

<h4><a name="H408">4.2.1.1  Network Virtual Terminal</a>
</h4>
<a name=index1389>The</a> NVT has a printer (or display) and a keyboard. The
keyboard produces outgoing data, which is sent over the TELNET connection. The
printer receives the incoming data. The basic characteristics of an NVT, unless
they are modified by mutually agreed options are:
<ul>
<li>The data representation is 7-bit ASCII transmitted in 8-bit bytes.
<li>The NVT is a half-duplex device operating in a line-buffered mode.
<li>The NVT provides a local echo function.
</ul>
All of these may be negotiated by the two hosts. For example, a local echo is
preferred because of the lower network load and superior performance but there
is an option for using a remote echo, although no host is required to use it.
<br><br><a name=figecho>
<img src="3376f99.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: Echo Option</i> - The remote echo function can be used instead
of the local echo if both parties agree.<br><br>
An NVT Printer has an unspecified carriage width and page length.
<a name=index1390>It</a> can handle printable ASCII characters (ASCII code 32
to 126) and understands some ASCII control characters such as: <br><br>
<a name=unnamed><img src=3376t12.gif></a><br>
<br><br>

<h4><a name="H411">4.2.1.2  TELNET Options</a>
</h4>
<p>There is an extensive set of TELNET options, and the reader should consult
<i>STD 1 - Official Internet Protocol Standards</i> for the standardization
state and status for each of them. At the time of writing, the following
options were defined: <br><br>
<a name=unnamed><img src=3376t13.gif></a><br>
<i>Table: <a name=index1412>TELNET</a> Options (Part 1 of 2)</i><br><br>
<br><br>
<a name=unnamed><img src=3376t14.gif></a><br>
<i>Table: <a name=index1431>TELNET</a> Options (Part 2 of 2)</i><br><br>
All of the standard options have a status of <i>recommended</i> and the
remainder have a status of <i>elective</i>. There is an <i>historic</i> version
of the TELNET Environment Option which is <i>not recommended</i>; it is TELNET
option 36 and was defined in RFC 1408.

<h5><a name="H414">Full-Screen Capability</a>
</h5>
<p><a name=index1433>Full-screen</a> TELNET is possible provided the client and
server have compatible full-screen capabilities. For example, VM and MVS
provide a TN3270-capable server. To use this facility, a TELNET client must
support TN3270.

<h4><a name="H415">4.2.1.3  TELNET Command Structure</a>
</h4>
<a name=index1434>The</a> communication between client and server is handled
with internal commands, which are not accessible by users. All internal TELNET
commands consist of 2 or 3-byte sequences, depending on the command type.
<p>The Interpret As Command (IAC) character is followed by a command code. If
this command deals with option negotiation, the command will have a third byte
to show the code for the referenced option.

negotiation about terminal type.<br><br>
<br><br>
<a name=unnamed><img src=3376t15.gif></a><br>
<br><br>

<h4><a name="H418">4.2.1.4  Option Negotiation</a>
</h4>
<a name=index1435>Using</a> internal commands, TELNET in each host is able to
negotiate options. The starting base of negotiation is the NVT capability: each
host to be connected must agree to this minimum. Every option can be negotiated
by the use of the four command codes WILL, WON'T, DO, DON'T described above.
In addition, some options have sub-options: if both parties agree to the
option, they use the SB and SE commands to manage the sub-negotiation. Here is
a simplified example of how option negotiation works. <br><br>
<a name=unnamed><img src=3376t16.gif></a><br>
<br><br>
<p>The terminal types are defined in <i>STD 2 - Assigned Numbers</i>.

<h4><a name="H420">4.2.1.5  TELNET Basic Commands</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1437>The</a> primary goal of the TELNET protocol is the
provision of a standard interface for hosts over a network. To allow the
connection to start, the TELNET protocol defines a standard representation for
some functions:
<dl>
<dt>
IP
<dd>Interrupt Process
<dt>
AO
<dd>Abort Output
<dt>
AYT
<dd>Are You There
<dt>
EC
<dd>Erase Character
<dt>
EL
<dd>Erase Line
<dt>
SYNCH
<dd>Synchronize
</dl>

<h3><a name="H421">4.2.2  Implementations</a>
</h3>

<h4><a name="H422">4.2.2.1  VM</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1438>The</a> TELNET client is a CMS program, that is, you must
log on to a VM user ID running CMS to use it. The TELNET server runs in the
TCP/IP virtual machine and uses the *CCS System service to create logical
terminals for incoming TELNET clients. VTAM (GCS) is not required to use the
TELNET protocol on a VM system.

<h5><a name="H423">Full-Screen Emulation</a>
</h5>
<p>When you use the <i>TELNET</i> command to connect to a host, you have to
choose the mode of operation. Line mode or transparent mode are the two
possibilities. In line mode you will be connected as a start-stop TTY terminal.
In transparent mode, the TELNET command supports IBM 3270-type display
stations. Examples of stations are:
<menu>
<li>IBM 3278 Display Station Models 2, 3, 4, and 5
<li>IBM 3279 Display Station Models 2, and 3.
</menu>
The mode of operation depends on the ability of both hosts to agree on a
terminal type.

<h5><a name="H424">Translate Tables</a>
</h5>
<p>The translation tables used to convert EBCDIC data to ASCII do not always
include desired characters. This becomes evident when you use the National
Language Support Option (NLS) with your operating system. TCP/IP for VM
provides standard tables. If needed, you can create and customize your own
translate tables, without having to recompile the source. The TELNET CLIENT
function only works in 7-bit mode. For more details, please refer to <i>IBM
TCP/IP Version 2 Release 3 for VM: Planning and Customization</i>.

<h5><a name="H425">Command Format</a>
</h5>
<pre>
TELNET ( foreignhost ( portnumber ))(( linemode ) translate filename ))
</pre>
<dl>
<dt>
Linemode
<dd>makes line mode instead of full-screen mode of connection. <br>
<dt>
Translate
<dd>defines the translation table to be used.
</dl>
While in a TELNET session, you may invoke subcommands such as:
<dl>
<dt>
AO
<dd>stop display output
<dt>
AYT
<dd>query connection
<dt>
HELP
<dd>help
<dt>
IP
<dd>interrupt process

<dd>quit session
<dt>
SYNCH
<dd>clear data path
</dl>
<p>For more details, please refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2 Release 3 for VM:
User's Guide</i>.

<h4><a name="H426">4.2.2.2  MVS</a>
</h4>
<p>TELNET provides:
<ol>
<li>Client and server 3270 full screen (transparent mode).
<li>Client and server line mode.
<li>Server for 3270 DBCS transfer mode which supports all full-screen access
from a VT100 or VT282 remote TELNET client.
<li>Client VT100 and VT220 full-screen support with either Communication
Subsystem For Interconnection (CSFI) from IBM or similar products from
third-party vendors.
</ol>
TELNET functionality:
<ul>
<li>Session establishment
<p>When a 3270 connection is established, the MVS TELNET server allows you to
choose which VTAM application a client will be automatically connected to
(usually this <i>default application</i> is a network solicitor). If you want
the incoming users to be able to choose between different VTAM applications
(that is, you do not specify a default application), the TELNET server will ask
for the application name. It is possible to restrict the use of an application
to some users (or none) and to have logical units (LU) reserved for some
specific users.
<li>Unformatted system services (USS) message 10 support
<p>USS message 10 support provides the ability to emulate the VTAM USS message
10 support. You may define one or more USS message 10 screens. The actual USS
message 10 screen to be used for a TELNET session can be selected via the LU
mapping functions.
<li>IP address to LU name mapping
<p>The IP-address-to-LU-name mapping function provides for the selection of
both an LU type 2 name and an application screen (or USS message 10 screen) for
incoming TELNET sessions. The selection is made by the following:
<ul>
<li>IP address
<li>Group of IP addresses
<li>Subnet
<li>Used link to the MVS host
</ul>
<li>Support for 3270 DBCS transform
<p>3270 DBCS transform mode provides 3270 full-screen emulation where the 3270
protocol processing is performed entirely by IBM TCP/IP for MVS. The remote
TELNET client may be emulating either a VT100 or VT282 type terminal.
<li>SMF reporting
<p>The TELNET server also provides <i>user accounting</i> and <i>control
information</i> using the MVS <i>SMF</i> (System Management Facility) records.
For example, client identity, IP address, timestamp of LOGON and LOGOFF and
VTAM LU can be recorded.
<p>A standard record type (SMF record type 118) has been registered.
<li>Modify console command
<p>The console operator may now query the status of active or inactive LUs in
use by the TELNET server.
<li>User set limits
<p>The user set option permits the user to control the number of TCP
connections or UDP ports that may be open at one time.
<li>Binary option for line mode
<p>With this option the line mode client is able to bypass the ASCII to EBCDIC
translation.
</ul>
<p>VTAM and TSO (refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 3 Release 1 for MVS:
Customization and Administration Guide</i> for more details about the
requirements) are required to use TELNET (both client and server).
<p>The capabilities of the TELNET function under MVS are the same as under VM.
<p>A programmable workstation may use either a TN3270 client or an rlogin
client to reach OpenEdition MVS services.

<h4><a name="H427">4.2.2.3  OS/400</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1439>The</a> OS/400 TELNET provides both client and server
functions. The OS/400 TELNET supports negotiations of the data transmission in
one of the following four operating modes: VT100 full-screen mode, ASCII line
mode, 5250 full-screen mode (see RFC 1205 for details) or 3270 full-screen
mode.
<ul>
<li>VT100 mode considerations:
<p>Although the AS/400 TELNET server supports VT100 clients, this is not the
preferred mode to use. A TN3270 or TN5250 client is preferred. The VT100
terminal is a character mode device, while the OS/400 is a block mode system.
In general, this results in larger amount of overhead associated with the
transmission of each VT100 keystroke. In contrast, the 5250 or 3270 block
devices buffer all keystrokes at the client system until an Attention
Identifier (AID) key is pressed.
<p>The OS/400 VT100 server requires the VT100 client to have the autowrap
option turned on. The Change Keyboard Map (CHGKBDMAP) and the Set Keyboard Map
(SETKBMAP) commands are available for keyboard remapping.
<li>ASCII line mode considerations:
<p>ASCII line mode is the standard TELNET network virtual terminal (NVT)
support and is assumed when 5250 full-screen mode or 3270 full-screen mode
cannot be negotiated. The client ASCII line mode provides one input line and
several scrollable output lines. Since the OS/400 operates in full-screen mode
and has screens with multiple input fields, this ASCII line mode TELNET server
implementation has several considerations. For example, a sign-on screen for
the AS/400 system is not automatically displayed when ASCII line mode is
negotiated. Please refer to <i>AS/400 TCP/IP Guide</i> for details.
<li>5250 full-screen considerations:
<p>5250 full-screen support can only be satisfactorily negotiated with a TELNET
application running on a system that supports 5250 TELNET. The client support
is similar to the OS/400 display station pass-through between two OS/400
systems. A TELNET user at the client OS/400 will receive an OS/400 5250 sign-on
display from the server system and will be able to run applications on the
remote system as if the display were locally attached to the server.
<p>The OS/400 server TELNET requires virtual controllers and devices (which are
automatically created by the system) to direct output on the client system.
OS/400 server TELNET must be allowed to automatically configure virtual
controllers and 5250 or 3270 devices.
<li>3270 full-screen considerations:
<p>3270 full-screen support is negotiated with any TELNET application that
supports 3270 TELNET. The TELNET user at the local OS/400 receives a 3270 logon
screen (for example, a VM logo screen) and is able to run applications on the
3270 host as if his display were locally attached. The 3270 TELNET server
support allows the IBM S/370 family systems and non-AS/400 systems client
TELNET users to sign on and run OS/400 5250 full-screen applications as if they
were locally attached to the AS/400. Automatic configuration of controllers and
devices is allowed. The OS/400 3270 full-screen mode TELNET server supports
3270 extended attributes, 3270-to-5250 keyboard re-mapping and workstation type
negotiations.
</ul>

<h4><a name="H428">4.2.2.4  AIX/6000</a>
</h4>
<p>AIX for RISC System/6000 supports both the TELNET client and server
functions.
<p>The following options are supported:
<menu>
<li>Binary Transmission (used in TELNET 3270 sessions)
<li>Suppress Go-Ahead (the RISC System/6000 system suppresses go-ahead)
<li>Timing Mark (recognized, but has a negative response)
<li>Extended Options List (recognized, but has a negative response)
<li>Echo (a user-changeable command)
<li>Term Type (allows the server to determine the terminal type used by the
client)
<li>SAK (Secure Attention Key)
<li>NAWS (Negotiate About Window Size)
</menu>
<p>The telnetd server (also know as a daemon) is a subserver controlled by the
inetd subsystem (also known as the super daemon).
<p>The telnet command is identical to the tn and the TN3270 commands. It
operates in two different modes:
<ul>
<li>Command Mode
<p>When the telnet command is issued without arguments, it enters the command
mode. The user may enter telnet subcommands.
<li>Input Mode
<p>When the telnet command is issued with arguments, it performs an open
subcommand with those arguments and then enters input mode. The type of input
mode is either character-at-a-time or line-by-line, depending on what the
remote system supports.
</ul>
<p>The terminal-type negotiation will take place between the <i>telnet</i>
command and the remote system when none of the following is used:
<ol>
<li>The -e command line flag
<li>The emulate environment variable
<li>The TN3270 command
</ol>
The 3270, DEC VT100 and NONE (no emulation) terminal types are supported. In
the case of 3270 emulation mode, keyboard remapping is supported.
<p>The rlogin command and the rlogind server (daemon) can also be used if both
the local and the target hosts are AIX (or UNIX) systems. The rlogin and
rlogind programs are considered as not-trusted because the remote host does not
require password authentication when one or both of the following conditions is
satisfied:
<ol>
<li>The local host is included in the remote /etc/hosts.equiv file, the local
user is not the root user, and the -l User flag is not specified.
<li>The local host and user name is included in the $HOME/.rhosts file in the
remote user account.
</ol>
For security reasons, any $HOME/.rhosts file must be owned by either the remote
user or root and should allow write access only by the owner.
<p><a name=index1440>Since</a> rlogin and rlogind are considered as
not-trusted, they can be disabled by running the securetcpip command. The
securetcpip command is used to enable additional TCP/IP security environment by
disabling commands that are not trusted. The telnet command and the ftpd daemon
are considered as trusted command and daemon, respectively. For more details,
please refer to <i>AIX Version 3.2 for RISC System/6000 Communication Concepts
and Procedures</i>.

<h4><a name="H429">4.2.2.5  AIX/ESA</a>
</h4>
<p>AIX/ESA supports both client and server TELNET functions.
<p>The TELNET server supports the following options: binary, echo/no echo,
suppress go ahead, timing mark and terminal type.
<p>The client function is implemented by the telnet and TN3270 commands. It
operates in two modes: <i>command mode</i> and <i>input mode</i>. The type of
input mode used is either <i>character-at-a-time</i> or <i>line-by-line</i>.
<p>If an HFT terminal is being used (the terminal supports the High-Function
Terminal driver such as the PS/2 console), TELNET can emulate either a DEC
VT100 terminal or an IBM 3270 terminal. The 3270 terminal types supported are:
3277-1, 3278-1, 3278-2, 3278-3, 3278-4 and 3278-5. If TELNET 3270 mode command
is being used with a color display, then 3279 terminal type is supported.
<p>In addition, the rlogin command can also be used to log into an AIX/ESA or
AIX/ESA-compatible system, if your local system is listed in the
/etc/hosts.equiv file on the remote system, or your system and your user name
are listed in the .rhosts file in your home directory on the remote system.
<p><b>Note:</b> Any login operation is subject to the AIX/ESA security features
in effect. For more details, please refer to <i>AIX/ESA Security Features
User's Guide</i>.

<h4><a name="H430">4.2.2.6  OS/2</a>
</h4>
<p>TCP/IP for OS/2 supports the following ASCII-based TELNET clients: TelnetPM,
Telnet, Ansiterm, Telneto.  The terminal types supported by these clients are
VT220, VT100, ANSI, HFT and NVT. Supported 3270 terminal emulator TELNET
clients are: PMANT, 3270 TELNET (PM) and TN3270.  In addition, TN5250, which
provides a PM-based 5250 emulation client, is supported.
<ul>
<li><i>VT220</i> - Uses emulation type VT220 to log on to a foreign host.
<li><i>VT100</i> - Uses emulation type VT100 to log on to a foreign host.
<p>This implements a superset of VT100, since it supports all 12 function keys
instead of just four.
<li><i>ANSI</i> - Uses command Ansiterm to log on to a foreign host using ANSI
mode, which is the native screen driver for an OS/2 command shell.
<li><i>Telneto</i> - Uses command Telneto to log on to a foreign host using
VT100 terminal emulation in true line mode.
<p>This is equivalent to VT200 in protocol support, and implements linemode
capabilities as defined in RFC 1184.
<li><i>PMANT</i> - Uses command PMANT to log on to a foreign host as a 3270
terminal.
<p>PMANT is an OS/2 Presentation Manager application which allows for keyboard
remapping, VIO font selections, terminal screen size definitions (24x80, 32x80,
43x80, 27x132), extended colors support, extended highlighting support and OS/2
clipboard support.
<li><i>3270 TELNET</i> - 3270 TELNET is a new client which is integrated in the
OS/2 WorkPlace Shell.  Apart from the improved GUI features, it provides
similar functions to those of PMANT.
<li><i>TN3270</i> - Use command TN3270 to log on to a foreign host as a 3270
terminal.
<p>TN3270 is a text application running under either an OS/2 window or
full-screen session. It is similar to PMANT but does not include the
Presentation Manager interface. TN3270 is recommended in lieu of PMANT when
using TCP/IP for OS/2 over slower serial lines, such as SLIP. It supports
keyboard remapping, alternative screen sizes and extended colors. Selectable
fonts and copy to clipboard are also supported in an OS/2 window session. It
only supports 80-column screens.
</ul>
<p>For any terminal type, a TELNET server must be running on the foreign host
that supports that specific terminal type.
<p>TCP/IP V2.0 for OS/2 can be a TELNET server, supporting VT220, VT100,
ANSITERM or TN clients. Note that TELNET users that log into an OS/2 TELNET
server have the capability of running any applications with the exception of
OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM) applications.

<h4><a name="H431">4.2.2.7  DOS</a>
</h4>
TCP/IP for DOS provides three TELNET client implementations:
<ul>
<li>DOS TELNET:  To be used from the DOS command line.
<li>DOS TN3270:  To be used from the DOS command line.
<li>Windows TELNET:  To be used through the Windows interface.
</ul>
<p>TCP/IP for DOS does not provide a TELNET Server implementation.
<p>The SETTERM command allows the configuration of a DOS TELNET client. This
program is menu driven and allows the following settings:
<ul>
<li>Key assignment: Specifies how keys are interpreted for the currently
defined session. For example, PF8 can be assigned to the Down function.
<li>Character translations: Specifies how a particular character is translated.
The decimal value (in the range of 0 to 255) for the byte to be translated must
be entered. After this value is supplied, the system prompts for the
replacement value (in the range of 0 to 255).
<li>Video attributes: Specifies foreground, background, and highlighting
attributes.
<li>Terminal choices: Specifies the order of preference for terminals (five
emulators are available) to use during a TELNET session.
<li>Session hot-key definitions: TELNET can open up to eight different
sessions. You can assign a hot-key to each session. The session hot key is used
to quickly switch among active sessions.
</ul>
<p>The modifications are stored in an ASCII file which can be referenced when
the TELNET command is issued. It is possible            to have different
configuration files for different settings.
<p>TELNET offers four terminal emulators:
<ul>
<li>VT220
<li>VT100
<li>IBM-3278-2
<li>ANSITERM
</ul>
<p>Windows TELNET offers six terminal emulators:
<ul>
<li>VT220
<li>VT100
<li>IBM-3278-2 through 3278-5
<li>ANSI
<li>TTY
<li>5250
</ul>
<p>The terminal preference is generally handled through the SETTERM command but
it can be specified with the TELNET command. All the TELNET sessions must be
opened from a full-screen window.
<p>TELNET provides a menu-driven interface that makes it easy to supply the
information needed to begin a TELNET session.
<p>When you TELNET to a remote host from a DOS workstation, at the same time
you can initiate the TFTP server. Then from the remote host, you will be able
to execute a TFTP session between that host and the PC running DOS. When a file
transfer request is detected, the TFTP Request menu is displayed. You can now
decide the appropriate action to take (accept this transfer, deny this
transfer, accept all future transfers, deny all future transfers). TELNET also
allows you to temporarily go back to a DOS shell.
