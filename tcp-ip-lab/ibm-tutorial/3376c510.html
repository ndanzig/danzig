<h2><a name="H824">5.10  TCP/IP and X.25</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1974>IP-X25</a> is a <i>standard protocol</i>. Its status is
<i>elective</i>.
<p>For detail on the Internet Protocol on X.25 networks, please refer to RFC
877 and RFC 1356.

<h3><a name="H825">5.10.1  Implementations</a>
</h3>
<p>MVS, VM, OS/2, OS/400 and AIX/6000 all support TCP/IP over X.25 networks.

<h4><a name="H826">5.10.1.1  MVS</a>
</h4>
<p>The TCPIPX25 address space runs a VTAM application program called XNX25IPI,
which is the interface between the TCPIP address space's IUCV driver and your
X.25 network. XNX25IPI communicates with the NPSI (X.25 NCP Packet Switching
Interface) in a front-end IBM 37XX Communications Controller.
<p>For more details, please refer to the <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 3 Release 1 for
MVS: Customization and Administration Guide</i> and <i>X.25 Network Control
Program Packet Switching Interface Planning and Installation</i>.

<h4><a name="H827">5.10.1.2  VM</a>
</h4>
<p>The X25IPI virtual machine runs a GCS (Group Control System) application
program called X25IPI, which is the interface between the TCPIP virtual
machine's IUCV driver and your X.25 network. X25IPI communicates with the NPSI
(X.25 NCP Packet Switching Interface) in a front-end IBM 37XX Communications
Controller.
<p>For more details, please refer to the <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2 Release 3 for
VM: Planning and Customization</i> and <i>X.25 Network Control Program Packet
Switching Interface Planning and Installation</i>.
<p>The   provides support for non-SNA users. It is designed to support
communications between hosts running TCP/IP over an X.25 network. For more
details, please refer to <i>IBM 9370 Information System X.25 Communications
Subsystem Description</i>.

<h4><a name="H828">5.10.1.3  X.25 Scenario using the IBM 9370</a>
</h4>

<br><i>Figure: X.25 Example Scenario</i><br><br>
<a name=index1975>Using</a> the two 9370 adapters, XI, NPSI, and standard
functions of TCP/IP, we may build a network allowing the following
possibilities:
<ul>
<li>From System A, a user can access System B using the   supported by TCP/IP.
This is transparent for the user doing a TELNET or FTP, which are standard
functions of TCP/IP.
<li>From System A to System C, the user enters the SNA world by an access to
NPSI. Then we are in the VTAM area. The link between VTAM and TCP/IP is
realized by X25IPI, which is a virtual machine owned by TCP/IP.
<li>From System A to System D, the TCP/IP connection is an SNA link over an
X.25 network. Viewed from TCP/IP, the physical network can be any one supported
by SNA.
<li>System B and System E may be linked through XI capabilities.
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b>  The   integrated into the IBM 9370 is only supported by the
Virtual Telecommunication Access Method (VTAM). It is designed as a part of  .
On the other hand, the   is supported only by TCP/IP.
