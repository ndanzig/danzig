<h2><a name="ibmint">1.3  IBM and the Internet</a>
</h2>
<p>In this section we will discuss the architectural and product support that
IBM provides for the Internet.

<h3><a name="blueprt">1.3.1  The IBM Open Blueprint</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index552>In</a> March 1992, IBM announced the Networking Blueprint
which is, essentially, a framework for structuring network diversity and
complexity with consistency and flexibility. <a name=index553>solutions</a>
best suited to your needs, irrespective of networking protocols and vendors.
<p>The Open Blueprint is an expansion of the Networking Blueprint and
incorporates the entire Networking Blueprint. The lower portion of the Open
Blueprint is identical to the Networking Blueprint. The upper portion of the
Open Blueprint is an expansion of the applications and application support
layers of the Networking Blueprint to show more detail in the application
environment. In this section only the networking portion of the Open Blueprint
is discussed in greater detail.
<p>What was the reason for the Networking Blueprint?
<p>An organization's networking requirements are driven by the need for
specific applications. Often the application requires a specific network
protocol because all applications are written for a specific Application
Programming Interface (API). Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li>Most UNIX or AIX programs were written for TCP/IP transport using the
Berkeley sockets API.
<li>Most SAA programs were written for SNA transport using CPI-C or other APPC
interfaces.
</ul>
<p>All other popular transport protocols protocols such as OSI, DECnet, NetBIOS
and IPX provide their own specific APIs.
<p>As a result of this, you have to have multiple separate networks composed of
different protocols, hardware components, bandwidth capabilities and
network-specific management capabilities. Besides this you need skill in all
these different segments.
<p>The goals of the Networking Blueprint are:
<ul>
<li>To allow you to buy and create applications without concern for the
underlying networking components and services
<li>To enable the incorporation of multiple network protocols into a single
network
<li>To permit an evolutionary exploitation of high bandwidth technologies and
the emerging applications that use them
</ul>
<p>What the Networking Blueprint is not:
<ul>
<li>The Blueprint is not a new architecture; it is a way to structure your
systems.
<li>It is not proprietary, but on the contrary is based on international and
industry standards.
<li>It does not imply totally new systems, but rather is bent on encompassing
legacy systems, applications and devices as well as systems conforming to the
new computing and communication models.
</ul>
<p>In order to reduce complexity, the Blueprint is separated into different
components which are discussed below. See
<a href="3376c13.html#figibmblue">Figure - IBM Networking Blueprint</a>.

<br><i>Figure: IBM Networking Blueprint</i><br><br>
<ul>
<li>Multivendor application support
<p>The multivendor application support addresses the problem of application
portability and interoperability across the widest possible set of hardware and
operating system platforms. It is essential that applications be developed
independently of the systems they will run on. Therefore a number of APIs are
recommended when new applications are to be written. These recommended APIs
are:
<ul>
<li>CPI-C (transactional)
<li><a name=index554>RPC</a> (client/server as per the OSF/DCE)
<li><a name=index555>MQI</a> (Message Queuing Interface)
</ul>
<p><a name=index556>Most</a> of these APIs are already available on the
following platforms: MVS, VM, OS/2, OS/400 and AIX/6000 as shown in
<a href="3376c13.html#tabapis">Table - Availability of APIs for IBM
Platforms</a>. <br><br>
<a name=tabapis><img src=3376t3.gif></a><br>
<i>Table: Availability of APIs for IBM Platforms</i><br><br>
<p>The APIs are available on many platforms from other vendors as well.
<p>It is IBM's strategy to offer application enabling systems that allow
porting to IBM and non-IBM systems.
<li><a name=spotmptn>
Multiprotocol networking
<p><a name=index557>The</a> multiprotocol networking component addresses the
problem of the multiplicity of networking protocols in most networks. A way of
reducing the number of physical networks is a multiprotocol network processor
such as the IBM 6611. It routes all the major protocols, including SNA APPN,
and uses only standard mechanisms, such as OSPF, to communicate with other
routers. In cases when standards do not exist, IBM contributes its technologies
to the industry (for example, Data Link Switching (DLSw) was published as IETF
RFC 1434).
<p>The even more important step in this direction is the Multi-Protocol
Transport Networking (MPTN) architecture. This technology  makes it possible to
minimize the number of protocols that must be supported in a network, and more
significantly on the desktops and servers, by decoupling the application from
the networking layer. MPTN was submitted to X/Open in December 1991.  The IBM
AnyNet product family fulfills this architecture. MPTN is part of the Common
Transport Semantics (CTS) layer in the Blueprint. The CTS works as shown in
<a href="3376c13.html#figbluects">Figure - Common Transport Semantics</a>.
<p>CTS architecture offers:
<ul>
<li>No interference when application and transport network protocol match
<li>MPTN function compensation and address mappings when applications and
transport network do not match
<li>Functions delivered by industry standards such as RFC 1001/1002 for NetBIOS
over TCP/IP
</ul>

<p>Please see <a href="3376c13.html#anynet">AnyNet</a> for further information
and a list of products already available.  For an architectural description see
<i>MPTN Architecture Tutorial and Product Implementations</i>.
<li>Subnetworking
<p>The subnetworking component addresses the rapid evolution of the
telecommunication technologies. It identifies and recommends the use of ITU-T,
IEEE and similar industry standards, to permit building LANs and WANs that are
protocol transparent. The strategic protocols are 802.3, 802.5, X.25, frame
relay (RFC 1490) and ATM. IBM's strategy fully acknowledges that tomorrow's
networks will mostly be based on the ATM technology, which will allow the
integration of audio, video and data and be an essential enabler for the full
deployment of multimedia applications. An example of a product in this layer is
the IBM 2220 Nways BroadBand Switch.
<li>Systems management
<p>The system management component is the necessary glue that makes any
network, large or small, operable. Network management applications will be
written in such a way that they are portable across, and can interoperate with,
a wide variety of IBM and non-IBM management platforms.
<p>The application portability will be achieved with the deployment of the
OSF/DME technology, including common APIs such as XMP. Multivendor
interoperability will come from supporting the CMIP, SNMP and SNA/MS network
management protocols.
</ul>

<h3><a name="anynet">1.3.2  AnyNet</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index558>The</a> IBM AnyNet product family is the implementation of
the Common Transport Semantics (CTS) in the IBM Networking Blueprint based on
the emerging standard of Multiprotocol Transport Networking (MPTN).
<a name=index559>Please</a> refer to Multiprotocol Networking described earlier
in this chapter.
<p>The idea behind AnyNet is to run matching applications which are designed to
operate over one specific type of network over other networks. For example, you
can run a host SNA printer application over a TCP/IP network. That means you
don't have to install an SNA connection to this location beside the existing
TCP/IP connection. The advantage of using AnyNet is the reduction of the number
of different transport protocols. You can run all your applications over one
kind of network if you like.
<ul>
<li>Anynet/2 SNA over TCP/IP
<p>You have access from a TCP/IP workstation to any APPC database, terminal
emulation or printer application running on the host, such as CICS, IMS, DB/2,
or TSO. The "AnyNet partner" could be another AnyNet/2 station or AnyNet/MVS.

<br><i>Figure: APPC over TCP/IP</i><br><br>
<li><a name=index560>AnyNet/2</a> Sockets over SNA
<p><a name=index561>With</a> this you have access to Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) Socket applications such as FTP, TELNET and NFS across an
SNA network.
<li>AnyNet/2 Sockets over SNA Gateway
<p>This gateway enables all native TCP/IP workstations to connect to similar
applications in an AnyNet/2 or AnyNet/MVS host across an existing SNA network.
It is also possible to install multiple gateways in order to connect two TCP/IP
networks across an existing SNA network. See
<a href="3376c13.html#figanygate">Figure - Multiple Gateways</a>.

<br><i>Figure: Multiple Gateways</i><br><br>
<li>AnyNet/2 NetBEUI over SNA
<p>Enables you to run NetBIOS applications such as IBM LAN Server and Lotus
Notes over an existing SNA network.
<li>AnyNet/MVS
<p>This feature is available with VTAM 4.2 for MVS/ESA.
