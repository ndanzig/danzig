<h2><a name="hippi">5.3  The IBM High-Performance Parallel Interface
(HIPPI)</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1945>The</a> IBM High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) is
an 800 Mbps data transfer device that operates in a variety of high-speed
computer environments.  It is an implementation of the ANSI X3.183-1991
High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI-PH) standard.
<p>The IBM HIPPI can attach devices that comply with the ANSI standard to
selected members of the IBM Enterprise System/3090 (ES/3090) and IBM Enterprise
System/9000 (ES/9000) family of computers. Some examples of these devices are
high-resolution real-time visualization devices, file servers, workstations or
supercomputers.

<h3><a name="H803">5.3.1  Implementations</a>
</h3>

<h4><a name="H804">5.3.1.1  MVS</a>
</h4>
<p>
<p>One of the following hardware RPQs is required for the HIPPI-supported
ES/3090 or ES/9000 family of computers: 8P1347, 8P1348, 8P1353 or 8P1354.
<p>The HIPPI software (RPQ P88039, program number 5799-DKW) makes the function
of the HIPPI available to the HIPPI application programs. MVS TCP/IP V3R1 is
one such program.
<p>The IBM HIPPI software actually provides both a high-level, multiplexing
interface and a low-level, exclusive-use interface. Basically, the high-level
multiplexed interface gives several applications the ability to use HIPPI at
the same time. This interface complies with the ANSI HIPPI-FP framing protocol.
The low-level, exclusive-use interface allows only a single application to
establish an association with it.
<p><b>Note:</b> MVS TCP/IP V3R1 was implemented to use the low-level interface.
This means that other software may not use HIPPI while MVS TCP/IP is using it.
<p>Please see <a href="3376c53.html#fighipfig">Figure - IBM HIPPI and MVS
TCP/IP</a> for an overview of the relationship of the various components.

<h3><a name="H806">5.3.2  HIPPI Draft Standards and Internet-Draft</a>
</h3>
<p>The ANSI X3T9.3 HIPPI working group drafted four standards covering:
<ul>
<li>(HIPPI-PH) the physical and electrical specification
<li>(HIPPI-FP) the framing protocol of a point-to-point interface
<li>(HIPPI-LE) the encapsulation of IEEE 802.2 LLC data packets
<li>(HIPPI-SC) the control of HIPPI physical layer switches
</ul>
<p>Please see <a href="3376c53.html#fighipans">Figure - Relationship of ANSI
HIPPI Draft Standards</a> for an overview of the relationship of the various
ANSI draft standards.

<p>The Internet-Draft "IP and ARP on HIPPI" by A. Nicholson, June 1992,
describes the HIPPI interface between a host and a crosspoint switch that
complies with the HIPPI-SC draft standard. This is a <i>working draft</i> which
is intended to become an Internet standard in the future.
<p><b>Note:</b> The HIPPI-SC switches are devices which allow a single HIPPI
device to switch between multiple HIPPI devices without involving protocols
above the HIPPI-PH layer.

<h3><a name="H808">5.3.3  Relationship of IBM HIPPI and the ANSI Draft
Standards</a>
</h3>
<p>The current IBM HIPPI does not support two items in the ANSI draft standard
X3.183-1991 (HIPPI-PH):
<ul>
<li>The IBM HIPPI does not support microbursts. Data is exchanged in packet
sizes that are integral multiples of 4096 bytes.
<li>The IBM HIPPI does not have a means for software to deactivate the REQUEST
signal of the IBM outbound channel once a program activates REQUEST by setting
the clear bit in the outbound control word.
</ul>
Please refer to <i>IBM HIPPI User's Guide and Programmer's Reference</i> for
details.
