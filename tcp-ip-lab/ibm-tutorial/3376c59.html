<h2><a name="ppp">5.9  Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)</a>
</h2>
<p>PPP is a <i>network-specific standard protocol</i> with STD number 51.
<a name=index1963>Its</a> status is <i>elective</i>. It is described in RFC
1661 and RFC 1662.
<p><a name=index1965>There</a> are a large number of <i>proposed standard
protocols</i> which specify the operation of PPP over different kinds of
point-to-point link. Each has a status of <i>elective</i>. The reader is
advised to consult <i>STD 1 - Internet Official Protocol Standards</i> for a
list of PPP-related RFCs which are on the Standards Track.
<p><a name=index1966>Point-to-Point</a> circuits in the form of asynchronous
and synchronous lines have long been the mainstay for data communications. In
the TCP/IP world, the de facto standard SLIP protocol has served admirably in
this area, and is still in widespread use for dial-up TCP/IP connections.
However, SLIP has a number of drawbacks:
<ul>
<li>SLIP defines only the encapsulation protocol, not any form of handshaking
or link control. Links are manually connected and configured, including the
specification of the IP address.
<li>SLIP is only defined for asynchronous links.
<li>SLIP cannot support multiple protocols across a single link; all packets
must be IP datagrams.
<li>SLIP does no form of frame error detection which forces re-transmission by
higher level protocols in the case of errors on noisy lines.
<li>SLIP provides no mechanism for compressing frequently used IP header
fields. Many applications over slow serial links tend to be single-user
interactive TCP traffic such as TELNET. This frequently involves small packet
sizes and therefore a relatively large overhead in TCP and IP headers which do
not change much between datagrams, but which can have a noticeably detrimental
effect on interactive response times.
<p>However, many SLIP implementations now use <i>Van Jacobsen Header
Compression</i>.  This is used to reduce the size of the combined IP and TCP
headers from 40 bytes to 8 bytes by recording the states of a set of TCP
connections at each end of the link and replacing the full headers with encoded
updates for the normal case where many of the fields are unchanged or are
incremented by small amounts between successive IP datagrams for a session.
<a name=index1967>This</a> compression is described in RFC 1144.
</ul>
The Point-to-Point protocol addresses these problems.
<p>PPP has three main components:
<ol>
<li>A method for encapsulating datagrams over serial links.
<li>A <i>Link Control Protocol (LCP)</i> for establishing, configuring, and
testing the data-link connection.
<li><a name=index1968>A</a> family of <i>Network Control Protocols (NCPs)</i>
for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols.
<a name=index1969>PPP</a> is designed to allow the simultaneous use of multiple
network-layer protocols.
</ol>
<p>Before a link is considered to be ready for use by network-layer protocols,
a specific sequence of events must happen. The LCP provides a method of
establishing, configuring, maintaining and terminating the connection. LCP goes
through the following phases:
<ol>
<li>Link establishment and configuration negotiation:
<p>In this phase, link control packets are exchanged and link configuration
options are negotiated. Once options are agreed upon, the link is <i>open</i>,
but not necessarily <i>ready</i> for network-layer protocols to be started.
<li>Link quality determination:
<p>This phase is optional. PPP does not specify the policy for determining
quality, but does provide low-level tools, such as echo request and reply.
<li>Authentication:
<p>This phase is optional. Each end of the link authenticates itself with the
remote end using authentication methods agreed to during phase 1.
<li>Network-layer protocol configuration negotiation:
<p>Once LCP has finished the previous phase, network-layer protocols may be
separately configured by the appropriate NCP.
<li>Link termination:
<p>LCP may terminate the link at any time. This will usually be done at the
request of a human user, but may happen because of a physical event.
</ol>
<p>The <i>IP Control Protocol (IPCP)</i> is the NCP for IP and is responsible
for configuring, enabling and disabling the IP protocol on both ends of the
point-to-point link. The IPCP options negotiation sequence is the same as for
LCP, thus allowing the possibility of reusing the code.
<p><a name=index1970>One</a> important option used with IPCP is <i>Van Jacobsen
Header Compression</i> which is used to reduce the size of the combined IP and
TCP headers from 40 bytes to approximately 4 by recording the states of a set
of TCP connections at each end of the link and replacing the full headers with
encoded updates for the normal case where many of the fields are unchanged or
are incremented by small amounts between successive IP datagrams for a session.
<a name=index1971>This</a> compression is described in RFC 1144.
