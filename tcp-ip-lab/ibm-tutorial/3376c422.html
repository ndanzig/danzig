<h2><a name="time">4.22  Time and Daytime Protocols</a>
</h2>
<p>Time is a <i>standard protocol</i>. Its status is <i>elective</i>. The
current TIME specification can be found in <i>RFC 868 - Time Server
Protocol</i>.
<p>Daytime is a <i>standard protocol</i>. Its status is <i>elective</i>. The
current daytime specification can be found in <i>RFC 867 - Daytime
Protocol</i>.

<h4><a name="H772">4.22.0.1  Concept</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1920>The</a> time protocol provides a machine-readable date and
time. It uses TCP or UDP as the transport vehicle. Port 37 (decimal) is used.
<ol>
<li>Used via TCP:
<menu>
<li>S: listen on port 37
<li>C: connect to port 37
<li>S: send the time as a 32-bit binary number
<li>C: receive the number
<li>C: close the connection
</menu>
<li>Used via UDP:
<menu>
<li>S: listen on port 37
<li>C: send empty datagram to port 37
<li>S: receive empty datagram
<li>S: send datagram containing the time as a 32-bit number
<li>C: receive the datagram
</menu>
</ol>
<p>The 32-bit number represents the number of elapsed seconds since midnight on
January 1st 1900 (GMT). It is suitable for a machine to set its own clock to
this, but it is not very human-readable.
<p>The daytime protocol is similar in concept, but the server will now send a
readable ASCII character string back to the client. The format of this ASCII
string is not formalized. Port 13 (decimal) is used for this protocol.

<h4><a name="H773">4.22.0.2  Implementations</a>
</h4>
<p>AIX/6000 provides both the client and server functions. The server function
is included in the base <i>inetd</i> process; the client part is provided
through the <i>setclock</i> command.
<p>TCP/IP for DOS provides the client function with the <i>setclock</i>
command.
