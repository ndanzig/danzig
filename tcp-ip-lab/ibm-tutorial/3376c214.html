layers.<br><br>

<h3><a name="H262">2.14.1  Differences</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index988>One</a> can only functionally position the internet model
to the ISO OSI model because basic differences exist such as:
<ul>
<li>In the internet protocol suite, a layer represents a reasonable packaging
of function.
<p>The ISO view, on the other hand, treats layers as rather narrow functional
groups, attempting to force modularity by requiring additional layers for
additional functions.
<p>In the TCP/IP protocols, a given protocol can be used by other protocols
within the same layer, whereas in the OSI model two separate layers would be
defined in such circumstances. Examples of such "horizontal dependencies" are
FTP, which uses the same common representation as TELNET on the "application
layer," and ICMP, which uses IP for sending its datagrams on the "internetwork"
layer.
<p>In practice, what we are discussing here is the difference between a de jure
standard, OSI, and a de facto standard, TCP/IP.  The focus in the TCP/IP world
is on agreeing on a protocol standard which can be made to work in diverse
heterogeneous networks. The focus in the OSI world has always been more on the
standard than the implementation of the standard.
<li>Efficiency and feasibility. The OSI norms tend to be prescriptive (for
instance the "layer N" must go through "all layers below it"), whereas the
TCP/IP protocols are descriptive, and leave a maximum of freedom for the
implementers. One of the advantages of the TCP/IP approach is that each
particular implementation can use operating system-dependent features,
generally resulting in a greater efficiency (fewer CPU cycles, more throughput
for similar functions), while still ensuring "interoperability" with other
implementations.
<p>Another way to see this is that most of the internet protocols have first
been developed (coded and tested), before being "described" in an RFC (usually
by the implementer) which clearly shows the feasibility of the protocols.
</ul>

<h3><a name="H263">2.14.2  The Internet World and OSI</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index990>The</a> Department of Defense (DoD), funder of the original
<a name=index992>ARPANET</a> research, made a statement on OSI in January '88,
<a name=index993>based</a> on the Government OSI Profile (GOSIP) of April 22,
1987.
<p>The following is an excerpt from the statement, which is published
<a name=index995>in</a> <i>RFC 1039 - A DoD Statement on OSI</i>:
"... It is intended to adopt the OSI protocols as a full
<strong>co-standard</strong> with the DoD protocols when GOSIP is formally
approved as a Federal Information Processing Standard. Two years thereafter,
the OSI protocols would become the sole mandatory interoperable protocol suite;
however, a capability for interoperation with DoD protocols would be provided
for the expected life of systems supporting the DoD protocols. ..."

<h3><a name="H264">2.14.3  TCP/IP and OSI Coexistence Considerations</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index996>If</a> your goal is TCP/IP-OSI coexistence, with an eye
toward eventually going to pure OSI, you basically have five choices, which
fall into two general categories: protocol-based and services-based.
<p>Protocol-based approaches include dual stacks, application-layer gateways
and transport-layer gateways. Services-based approaches include
transport-service bridges and network tunnels.

<h4><a name="H265">2.14.3.1  Dual Stacks - The Simple Approach</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index997>The</a> simplest way to integrate TCP/IP and OSI is to put
both protocol stacks in every machine on the network.
<br><br><a name=fig>
<img src="3376f64.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: Dual Stacks</i><br><br>
<p>Although this is a relatively straightforward approach, it involves a
fundamental drawback: two networks will be running over the same set of wires,
but the two sets of protocol cannot interoperate. Users are forced to choose
between them. This disadvantage of having two separate networks can be an
advantage. Those users who want to use TCP/IP can use TCP/IP, those who want to
use OSI can use OSI. Another advantage is that an existing TCP/IP network will
not be disturbed. But, dual stacks are memory-intensive, and they have to be
put on every machine on the TCP/IP-OSI networks.

<h4><a name="H267">2.14.3.2  Application-Layer Gateways - The DoD Approach</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index998>This</a> approach eliminates a major drawback of dual
stacks (lack of application internetworking). The application-layer gateways
convert protocol data units (PDU) from one stack's application protocol to the
other's. With application-layer gateways it is possible to communicate from any
TCP/IP system to any OSI system. It is not necessary to choose between
protocols, because either application protocol will work on either stack.
<br><br><a name=fig>
<img src="3376f65.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: Application-Layer Gateway Node</i><br><br>
<p>Another advantage of application-layer gateways is that you do not have to
add anything to, or otherwise modify, the end systems. This is because the
application-layer gateway (which includes both protocol stacks) sits between
the systems and handles all of the protocol conversion. But you will often lose
functionality in the conversion from one application protocol to another
because of imperfect mapping between the two protocols, mainly when going from
OSI to TCP/IP applications. This is because OSI applications have richer
functionalities. Another disadvantage of application-layer gateways is that
they produce bottlenecks that will cause performance degradation if your
gateway is not powerful enough.

<h4><a name="H269">2.14.3.3  Transport-Layer Gateways - The Wrong Approach</a>
</h4>
<br><br><a name=fig>
<img src="3376f66.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: Transport-Layer Gateway Node</i><br><br>
<p><a name=index999>CLNP</a> stands for <i>ConnectionLess Network Protocol</i>
(see figure above).
<p>If you have an environment with the TCP transport protocol on one side and
the OSI TP4 transport protocol on the other, you need a software mechanism that
dynamically translates TCP packets into TP4 packets. This approach is
considered to be wrong because no applications support TCP on one end and TP4
on the other, and because the addresses change on either part of the gateway,
which involves loss of directories services.
<p>The three approaches examined so far focus on protocol conversion. However,
it is possible to virtually ignore the protocol itself and to concentrate on
emulating services. This is where transport-service bridges and network tunnels
come into play.

<h4><a name="H271">2.14.3.4  Transport-Service Bridges - The ISODE Approach</a>
</h4>
<br><br><a name=fig>
<img src="3376f67.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: Transport-Service Bridge Node</i><br><br>
<p><a name=index1002>ISODE</a> stands for <i>International Standards
Organization Development Environment</i>. It is a publicly available collection
of library routines and programs that implement OSI upper-layer services.
<p>In a TCP-to-TP4 example, a transport-service bridge would make the TCP
service look like a TP4 service. You accomplish this by emulating the TP4
service. With transport-service bridges you can run OSI applications over
TCP/IP networks. One advantage of this approach is that you can use just one
application protocol-OSI. Only the underlying layers need change between the
two environments. A transport-service bridge is essentially a router that
copies PDUs, as opposed to translating them. RFC 1006 defines the way to
produce OSI transport services on top of TCP. The main disadvantage of this
approach is that you do not have end-to-end (source to destination) checksum.
In the example of TCP-to-TP4 environment, you have a TCP checksum on the source
side of the transport-service bridge and a TP4 checksum on the destination
side. Like gateways, transport-service bridges introduce a single point of
failure. You can use transport-service bridges not only for TCP/IP-to-OSI
implementations but also for OSI-to-OSI integration jobs. For example, OSI
includes different transport protocols, such as TP0 for wide area networks and
TP4 for local area networks. Transport-service bridges are viable candidates
for linking those different OSI transports.

<h4><a name="H273">2.14.3.5  Network Tunnels - The Difficult Approach</a>
</h4>
<br><br><a name=fig>
<img src="3376f68.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: Network Tunnels</i><br><br>
<p><a name=index1004>This</a> approach eliminates the single point of failure
and gives you end-to-end checksums. Network tunnels are one level down from the
transport-service bridge approach. Instead of transport-service emulation, they
use packet-level service emulation. Network tunnels operate at the network
layer instead of at the transport layer. They encapsulate OSI CLNP packets in
IP packets and run them over IP networks. Network tunnels are essentially CLNP
routers.
<p>Network tunnels provide end-to-end checksums, a high degree of transparency,
but they require OSI CLNP-based networks and are difficult to implement.
