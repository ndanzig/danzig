<h2><a name="H744">4.16  Line Printer Daemon</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1894>The</a> Line Printer Daemon protocol is an
<i>informational protocol</i>. Its status is <i>limited use</i>. The current
specification is in RFC 1179. <a name=index1895>Note</a> that this RFC does not
specify an Internet standard. However, the function has been part of UNIX
systems for a long time (in <i>uucp</i>).

<h3><a name="H745">4.16.1  Implementations</a>
</h3>

<h4><a name="lprvm">4.16.1.1  VM</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1896>The</a> LPR client and server functions are supported by
VM TCP/IP.
<p>The server runs in the <i>LPSERVE</i> virtual machine and allows you to
print on local (VM printer or punch), remote (for example, a printer attached
to an OS/2 workstation and managed by an LPR server) or RSCS printers. The RSCS
printers can be connected to the RSCS subsystem in the same system as the
<i>LPSERVE</i> virtual machine or to a remote RSCS. In the latter, the remote
host does not need to have TCP/IP installed, but the two VM systems must be
connected via RSCS.
<p>Using the LPR server function on a VM system, it is possible to submit a job
on an MVS system, if the VM and MVS system are connected. Once again, the MVS
system does not need TCP/IP. MVS will send the job output back to the
<i>LPSERVE</i> VM user ID (this can be overridden with the <tt>/*ROUTE PUNCH
VM.USER</tt> and <tt>/*ROUTE PRINT VM.USER</tt> parameters where <tt>VM</tt> is
the node ID of the VM system and <tt>USER</tt> is the user ID that will receive
the output). It is not possible to route the output back to the originating
workstation.

<h4><a name="lprmvs">4.16.1.2  MVS</a>
</h4>
<p>Both the LPR (client) and LPD (server) functions are supported by MVS
TCP/IP.
<p>The LPD (server) runs in a separate address space in your MVS system. It
listens on TCP port 515. The printers supported can be locally attached, NJE
network-attached or remotely attached to another TCP/IP LPD server.
<p>The following LPR (client) user commands are available:
<ul>
<li><tt>LPRSET</tt>: to set your default TCP/IP printer
<li><tt>LPR</tt>: to print a file on a remote printer
<li><tt>LPQ</tt>: to list the printer queue on a printer
<li><tt>LPRM</tt>: to remove a job from the printer queue on a host
</ul>
<p>Please refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 3 Release 1 for MVS: User's Guide</i>
for more details.

<h5><a name="H748">Network Print Facility (NPF)</a>
</h5>
<p>The Network Print Facility allows users to send print output to LPD print
servers on the TCP/IP network. JES2 and JES3 output and VTAM SNA character
stream (SCS or LU type 1) and 3270 data stream output (LU types 0 and 3) may be
printed on the TCP/IP network printers.
<p><b>Note:</b> The NPF feature has to be ordered separately. There is no extra
charge.

Facility</i> for more details.

<h4><a name="H750">4.16.1.3  OS/400</a>
</h4>
<p>The LPR client and LPD server functions are supported by OS/400.

<h4><a name="H751">4.16.1.4  AIX/6000</a>
</h4>
<p>The print server application consists of:
<ul>
<li>A client back-end program called <i>LPRBE</i> which sends the file to be
printed to a specified print-server host and to a specified print queue.
<li>The server application <i>lpd</i> (also called the <i>lpd daemon</i> in
UNIX terminology). The server will accept print requests only from foreign
hosts listed in its control file <i>/etc/hosts.lpd</i>. This is further limited
to the foreign hosts listed in the /etc/hosts.equiv. It also implements
spooling/queuing for the jobs to be printed, provides for separator and banner
pages, etc.
</ul>
<p>The print server function uses TCP/IP port number 515. Each print request
consists of three parts:
<ul>
<li>Control file: contains name(s) of data file(s) to be printed, together with
information about the print job, such as the information that should go on the
title page.
<li>Data file(s) to be printed.
<li>Temporary file used to create the print job.
</ul>
<p>The print client opens the printer port 515 on the remote host, and then
sends lines of text to the server, first the control file, followed by the data
file(s).

<h5><a name="H752">AIX Print Services Facility/6000</a>
</h5>
<p>This product implements the IBM Advanced Function Printing (AFP)
capabilities to the RISC System/6000.
<p>You can move data, manage resources, and  provide connectivity to AIX, UNIX,
MVS, VM, OS/2, OS/400 and DOS environments by using TCP/IP and Network File
System (NFS) protocols. With the lpr command you can submit print jobs from the
afore-mentioned environments. The use of networked resources allows you to
maintain print resources on the system where they were created and attach them
with NFS to the PSF/6000 server with the NFS mount command. For  example,
overlays created with Overlay Generation Language/370 (OGL/370) and existing in
MVS system libraries or on a Conversational Monitoring System (CMS) minidisk
can be remotely mounted for use with PSF/6000 by means of NFS.
<p>For more detail please refer to <i>IBM Print Services Facility/6000: Print
Services Facility for AIX Users</i>.

<h4><a name="H753">4.16.1.5  OS/2</a>
</h4>
<p>The LPR client and LPD server functions are supported by TCP/IP for OS/2.
<p>The following commands are available:
<ul>
<li>LPD starts the LPD server on your local host.
<li>LPQ allows you to query a remote printer attached to a network host that
provides print spooling services.
<li>LPRM allows you to remove a job that is printing on a remote printer
attached to a network host that provides print spooling services.
<li>LPR allows you to transfer the contents of a file from your PC to a network
host that provides print spooling services.
<li>LPRMON allows you to redirect the output of a parallel port from your PC to
a network host that provides print spooling services. This allows you to print
to an LPR server without an application using the Line Printer protocol
directly. Please refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2.0 for OS/2: User's Guide</i>
for more details.
<li><tt>LPRPORTD</tt>: a Workplace Shell application that allows you to
redirect, using the "drag and drop" technique, the output of a parallel port on
your PC to a network host that provides print spooling services.
</ul>

<h4><a name="H754">4.16.1.6  DOS</a>
</h4>
<p>TCP/IP for DOS provides both the client (LPR) and server (LPD) functions.
<p>The <i>LPR</i>, <i>LPQ</i>, <i>LPRM</i> and <i>LPRMON</i> commands are
supported. Please refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2.1.1 for DOS: User's
Guide</i> for more details.
