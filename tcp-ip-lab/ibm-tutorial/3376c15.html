<h2><a name="H45">1.5  Request For Comments (RFC)</a>
</h2>
<p>The Internet protocol suite is still evolving through the
<a name=index580>mechanism</a> of <i>Request For Comments</i> (RFC). New
protocols (mostly application protocols) are being designed and implemented by
researchers, and are brought to the attention of the Internet community in the
form of an RFC.
<a href=3376footnotes.html#footnote0>(0)</a><a name=index583>The</a> RFC
mechanism is overseen by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB). The largest
source of RFCs is the <a name=index585>Internet</a> Engineering Task Force
(IETF) which is a subsidiary of the IAB.  However, anyone may submit a memo
proposed as an RFC to the RFC Editor.  There are a set of rules which RFC
authors must follow in order for an RFC to be accepted.  These rules are
themselves described in an RFC (RFC 1543) which also indicates how to submit a
proposal for an RFC.
<p>Once an RFC has been published, all revisions and replacements are published
as new RFCs.  A new RFC which revises or replaces an existing RFC is said to
``update'' or to ``obsolete'' that RFC.  The existing RFC is said to be
``updated by'' or ``obsoleted by'' the new one.  For example RFC 1521 which
describes the MIME protocol is a ``second edition'', being a  revision of RFC
1341 and RFC 1590 is an amendment to RFC 1521. RFC 1521 is therefore labelled
like this: ``Obsoletes RFC 1341; Updated by RFC 1590''. Consequently, there is
never any confusion over whether two people are referring to different versions
of an RFC, since there are never different versions.
<p>Some RFCs are described as <i>information  documents</i> while others
describe Internet protocols. The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) maintains a
list of the RFCs that describe the protocol suite. Each of these is assigned a
<i>state</i> and a <i>status</i>.
<p>An Internet protocol can have one of the following states:
<dl>
<dt>
<a name=index586>Standard</a>
<dd><a name=index587>The</a> IAB has established this as an official protocol
for the Internet. These are separated in two groups:
<ol>
<li>IP protocol and above, protocols that apply to the whole Internet.
<li>Network-specific protocols, generally specifications of how to do IP on
particular types of networks.
</ol>
<dt>
Draft standard
<dd><a name=index588>The</a> IAB is actively considering this protocol as a
possible standard protocol. Substantial and widespread testing and comments are
desired. Comments and test results should be submitted to the IAB. There is a
possibility that changes will be made in a draft protocol before it becomes a
standard.
<dt>
Proposed standard
<dd><a name=index589>These</a> are protocol proposals that may be considered by
the IAB for standardization in the future. Implementations and testing by
several groups are desirable. Revision of the protocol is likely.
<dt>
Experimental
<dd><a name=index590>A</a> system should not implement an experimental protocol
unless it is participating in the experiment and has coordinated its use of the
protocol with the developer of the protocol.
<dt>
Informational
<dd><a name=index591>Protocols</a> developed by other standard organizations,
or vendors, or that are for other reasons outside the purview of the IAB may be
published as RFCs for the convenience of the Internet community as
informational protocols. Such protocols may in some cases also be recommended
for use on the Internet by the IAB.
<dt>
Historic
<dd><a name=index592>These</a> are protocols that are unlikely to ever become
standards in the Internet either because they have been superseded by later
developments or due to lack of interest.
</dl>
<p>Definitions of protocol status:
<dl>
<dt>
<a name=index593>Required</a>
<dd><a name=index594>A</a> system must implement the required protocols.
<dt>
Recommended
<dd><a name=index595>A</a> system should implement the recommended protocol.
<dt>
Elective
<dd><a name=index596>A</a> system may or may not implement an elective
protocol. The general notion is that if you are going to do something like
this, you must do exactly this.
<dt>
Limited use
<dd><a name=index597>These</a> protocols are for use in limited circumstances.
This may be because of their experimental state, specialized nature, limited
functionality, or historic state.
<dt>
Not recommended
<dd><a name=index598>These</a> protocols are not recommended for general use.
This may be because of their limited functionality, specialized nature, or
experimental or historic state.
</dl>

<h3><a name="H47">1.5.1  Internet Standards</a>
</h3>
<p>Proposed standard, draft standard and standard protocols are described as
being on the <i>Internet Standards Track</i>. <a name=index600>The</a>
standards track is controlled by the <i>Internet Engineering Steering Group
(IESG)</i> of the IETF. When a protocol reaches the standard state it is
assigned <a name=index602>a</a> standard number (STD). The purpose of STD
numbers is to clearly indicate which RFCs describe Internet standards. STD
numbers reference multiple RFCs when the specification of a standard is spread
across multiple documents. Unlike RFCs, where the number refers to a specific
document, STD numbers do not change when a standard is updated. STD numbers do
not, however, have version numbers since all updates are made via RFCs and the
RFC numbers are unique. Thus to unambiguously specify which version of a
standard one is referring to, the standard number and all of the RFCs which it
includes should be stated. For instance, the Domain Name System (DNS) is STD 13
and is described in RFCs 1034 and 1035. To reference the standard, a form like
``STD-13/RFC-1034/RFC-1035'' should be used. For a description of the Standards
Process, see <i>RFC 1602 -- The Internet Standards Process - Revision 2</i>.
<p>For some standards track RFCs the status category does not always contain
enough information to be useful. It is therefore supplemented, notably for
routing protocols by an <i>applicability statement</i> which is given either in
STD 1 or in a separate RFC.
<p>References to the RFCs and to STD numbers will be made  throughout this
book, since they form the basis of all  TCP/IP protocol implementations.
<p>Four Internet standards are of particular importance:
<dl>
<dt>
STD 1 - Internet Official Protocol Standards
<dd><a name=index604>This</a> standard gives the state and status of each
Internet protocol or standard, and defines the meanings attributed to each
different state or status.  It is issued by the IAB approximately quarterly. At
the time of writing this standard is in RFC 1780 (March 1995).
<dt>
STD 2 - Assigned Internet Numbers
<dd><a name=index607>This</a> standard lists currently assigned numbers and
other protocol parameters in the Internet protocol suite.
<a name=index609>It</a> is issued by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA). The current edition at the time of writing is RFC 1700 (October 1994).
<dt>
STD 3 - Host Requirements
<dd><a name=index613>This</a> standard defines the requirements for Internet
host software (often by reference to the relevant RFCs).  The standard comes in
two parts: <i>RFC 1122 - Requirements for Internet hosts - communications
layer</i> and <i>RFC 1123 - Requirements for Internet hosts - application and
support</i>.
<dt>
STD 4 - Gateway Requirements
<dd><a name=index616>This</a> standard defines the requirements for Internet
gateway (router) software. It is RFC 1009.
</dl>

<h3><a name="H48">1.5.2  For Your Information (FYI)</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index618>A</a> number of RFCs which are intended to be of wide
interest to Internet users are classified as <i>For Your Information (FYI)</i>
documents. They frequently contain introductory or other helpful information.
Like STD numbers, an FYI number is not changed when a revised RFC is issued.
Unlike STDs, FYIs correspond to a single RFC document. For example, <i>FYI 4 --
FYI on Questions and Answers - Answers to Commonly asked ``New Internet User''
Questions</i> is currently in its fourth edition. The RFC numbers are 1177,
1206, 1325 and 1594.

<h3><a name="H49">1.5.3  Obtaining RFCs</a>
</h3>
<p>All RFCs are available publicly, both in printed and electronic form from
the Internet Network Information Center or InterNIC (<i>internic.net</i>).
<a name=index619>Prior</a> to 1993, the NIC function was performed by the DDN
NIC (<i>nic.ddn.mil</i>). <a name=index620>See</a> RFC 1400 for more
information about the transition.
<ul>
<li><a name=index622>RFCs</a> can be obtained in printed form from: <br>
                   Network Solutions, Inc.<br>
                   Attn: InterNIC Registration Service<br>
                   505 Huntmar Park Drive<br>
                   Herndon, VA 22070<br>
<br>
                   Help Desk Telephone Number:<br>

<br>
<li><a name=index624>To</a> get the electronic form, users may use anonymous
FTP to <i>ds.internic.net</i> (198.49.45.10) and retrieve files from the
directory <i>rfc</i>, or Gopher to <i>internic.net</i> (198.41.0.5).
<li><a name=index625>For</a> information on other methods of accessing RFCs by
E-mail or FTP, send an E-mail message to ``rfc-info@ISI.EDU'' with the message
body ``help: ways_to_get_rfcs''.  For example:
<pre>
To: rfc-info@ISI.EDU
Subject: getting rfcs

help: ways_to_get_rfcs
</pre>
<li><a name=index626>If</a> you have World Wide Web access, there are many
sites that maintain RFC archives.  One that you might try is the MAGIC Document
Archive at <i>http://www.msci.magic.net/docs/rfc/rfc_by_num.html</i>.
<li><a name=index627>RFCs</a> can also be obtained through the IBM VNET network
using the following command:
<pre>
EXEC TOOLS SENDTO ALMVMA ARCNET RFC GET RFCnnnn TXT *
</pre>
Where <i>nnnn</i> refers to the number of the RFC.
<p>To obtain the list of all the RFCs (and to know if they are available in TXT
format or in PostScript format), use the command:
<pre>
EXEC TOOLS SENDTO ALMVMA ARCNET RFC GET RFCINDEX TXT *
</pre>
</ul>
There is also an STDINDEX TXT file and an FYIINDEX TXT file which list those
RFCs which have an STD or FYI number.

<h3><a name="H50">1.5.4  Major Internet Protocols</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index628>To</a> give an idea of the importance of the major
protocols, we list some of them together with their current state and status
and STD number where applicable in <a href="3376c15.html#tabstd1">Table - The
Current state and status and STD numbers of Important Internet protocols</a>.
The complete list can be found in <i>RFC 1780 - Internet Official Protocol
Standards</i>. <b>Legend:</b> <br>
<b>State:</b> Std. = Standard; Draft = Draft Standard; Prop. = Proposed
Standard; Info. = Informational; Hist. = Historic <br>
<b>Status:</b> Req. = Required; Rec. = Recommended; Ele. = Elective; Not = Not
Recommended <br><br>
<a name=tabstd1><img src=3376t5.gif></a><br>
<i>Table: The Current state and status and STD numbers of Important Internet
protocols</i><br><br>
<p>At the time of writing there is no RFC associated with the HyperText
Transfer Protocol used in World Wide Web implementations.  However, the
document <i>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</i> written by Tim Berners-Lee
may be obtained at <i>ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/doc/http-spec.text</i>.
<p>In addition, the following RFCs describe the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
and associated concepts:
<ul>
<li><i>RFC 1630 - Universal Resource Identifiers in WWW</i>
<li><i>RFC 1737 - Functional Requirements for Uniform Resource Names</i>
<li><i>RFC 1738 - Uniform Resource Locators (URL)</i>
</ul>
