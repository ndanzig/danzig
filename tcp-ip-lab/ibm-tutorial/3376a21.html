</h2>
<p>Open Software Foundation (OSF) is a not-for-profit research and development
organization that supplies software essential for creating open systems
computing environment. Originally founded by IBM, DEC, Apollo, HP, Groupe Bull,
Nixdorf and Siemens, OSF now has over 350 members worldwide.
<p>OSF has defined a Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) to simplify
building computer systems applications in a heterogeneous environment.
<p>Founded in 1984, X/Open is a worldwide, independent open systems
organization dedicated to developing an open, multivendor Common Applications
Environment (CAE) based on de facto and international standards.
<p>In August of 1992, X/Open and OSF announced a joint effort to integrate
OSF's DCE into X/Open's Common Applications Environment (CAE).
