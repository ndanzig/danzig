<h2><a name="6611">5.16  The IBM Nways Router Family</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1998>IBM</a> offers two different multiprotocol routers:
<ul>
<li>IBM 6611 Nways Network Processor
<p>Full function, multiprotocol, multiport router and bridge, based on IBM RISC
technology.
<li>IBM 2210 Nways Multiprotocol Router
<p>Full function, low cost, entry node for small workgroups or remote offices
based on the MC68360 processor.
</ul>
<p>Following is a brief description of both routers and their major functions.

<h3><a name="H844">5.16.1  IBM 6611 Network Processor</a>
</h3>
<p>This router is offered in four different models, 120, 125, 145 and 175. The
second digit of the model number represents the number of available slots for
network adapter cards. The model 120 is offered in 10 fixed configurations
while all others can hold any of the following adapters:
<ul>
<li>2-Port Multi-Interface Serial Adapter
<li>4-Port Multi-Interface Serial Adapter
<li>2-Port Token-Ring Network 16/4 Adapter
<li>Multi-Interface Serial/Token-Ring Adapter
<li>2-Port Ethernet Adapter
<li>Multi-Interface Serial/Ethernet Adapter
<li>4-Port SDLC Adapter
</ul>
For more details, please refer to <i>IBM 6611 Network Processor Introduction
and Planning Guide</i>.
<p>The software support of the 6611 is provided by the preloaded <i>IBM
Multiprotocol Network Program 1.3 (MPNP 5648-016)</i>. It provides the
following major protocol functions:
<ul>
<li>TCP/IP
<p>RIP, RIP V2 with variable subnet masking, OSPF, EGP, BGP, BOOTP
request/reply forwarding for centrally located BOOTP server
<li>IPX
<li>DECnet (Phase IV and Phase IV-Prime)
<li>AppleTalk (Phase 2)
<li>Banyan VINES
<li>XNS
<li>Source-route bridging
<li>Transparent bridging
<li>Translational bridging
<li>Frame Relay
<p>RFC 1490: Multiprotocol Interconnect over Frame Relay supported for all
protocols
<p>RFC 1293: InARP support for all protocols
<li>PPP
<p>RFCs: 1171, 1331, 1332, 1333, 1548, 1549 and others for specific protocols.
<p>All protocols are supported on PPP
<p>Link quality monitoring is supported
<li>X.25
<li>SNA (over DLSw) and APPN
<p>Integration of SNA and APPN in the multiprotocol network
<li>NetBIOS (over DLSw)
</ul>

<h4><a name="H845">5.16.1.1  Configuration, Management and Maintenance</a>
</h4>
The <i>Configuration Program</i> enables you to create a 6611 configuration
which defines the interfaces and protocols you want to run. This program runs
on the AIX/6000, OS/2 and DOS Windows platform and provides a graphical user
interface for easy configuration. After you have finished the configuration the
program creates a diskette with the binary files for the 6611.
<p>The <i>System Manager</i> provides menu-driven and command line interfaces
to view statistics, perform problem determination, install and update software,
access other nodes in the network or make configuration changes.
<p>The SNMP agent includes the following major functions:
<ul>
<li>All standard MIB II objects
<li>Enterprise-specific 6611 MIBs
<li>RFC 1493 - Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges
<li>RFC 1525 - Definitions of Managed Objects for Source Routing Bridges
<li>TRAP generation and GET/SET support, for example, SNMP SET
Activate/Deactivate APPN Ports
</ul>
<p>The IBM 6611 is fully interoperable with the IBM 2210 and routers from other
vendors if they comply with the open standards.
<p>The newest 6611 MIB is available from the anonymous FTP server:
ftp://venera.isi.edu/mib on the Internet.
<p>For more details, please refer to <i>IBM Multiprotocol Network Program:
User's Guide</i>.

<h3><a name="H846">5.16.2  IBM 2210 Nways Multiprotocol Router</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1999>This</a> is a low-cost router with very rich functionality
for branch office environments which need to be connected to the multiprotocol
backbone of an enterprise. All configurations offer at least one LAN and two
serial ports.  Optionally, there is an ISDN-BRI interface which became
available in April 1995 in selected European countries and Japan. The planar
board includes processor, memory and interfaces for LAN, WAN and ISDN. The
hardware is preconfigured and reconfiguration is not possible.
<a href="3376c516.html#tab2210in">Table - IBM 2210 Model and Connectivity
Offerings</a> gives you an overview of the different models and included
interfaces. The models with larger memory should be considered for larger
networks. <br><br>
<a name=tab2210in><img src=3376t21.gif></a><br>
<i>Table: IBM 2210 Model and Connectivity Offerings</i><br><br>

<h4><a name="H848">5.16.2.1  Configuration, Management and Maintenance</a>
</h4>
The IBM 2210 comes with a configuration program similar to the IBM 6611. It
runs on DOS/Windows, OS/2 and AIX platforms. This program aids you in
configuring ports and software functions and allows you to make remote
configuration changes while the 2210 is operational. All the configuration is
done with an easy-to-use graphical user interface.
<p>The SNMP agent includes the following:
<ul>
<li>All standard MIB II objects
<li>Enterprise-specific 2210 MIBs for features like DLSw as well as Vital
Product Data information
<li>RFC MIBs for protocols like PPP and Frame Relay
<li>TRAP generation and GET support
</ul>
<p>The IBM 2210 is fully interoperable with the IBM 6611.
<p>The newest 2210 MIB is available from the anonymous FTP server:
ftp://venera.isi.edu/mib on the Internet.
<p>For more details, please refer to <i>IBM Nways Multiprotocol Routing Network
Services: Software User's Guide</i>.
<p>The product <i>AIX Router and Bridge Manager/6000</i> based on <i>NetView
for AIX</i> provides a graphical user interface in order to manage both the
6611s and the 2210s in your network.
