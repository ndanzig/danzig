<h2><a name="H799">5.2  HYPERchannel Adapter</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1941>HYPERchannel</a> A is a 50 Mbps, baseband, CSMA with
collision avoidance network using a coaxial bus cable. Each network adapter can
control up to four trunks (coaxial cable). It is used to interconnect large
mainframe computers and high-speed peripherals. This adapter has to be
connected to a BLKMPXR channel. It appears as a 64-address control unit to the
operating system.
<p>Both TCP/IP for VM and TCP/IP for MVS support HYPERchannel Series A devices.
In addition, TCP/IP for VM and MVS supports the HYPERchannel Series DX devices,
provided they function as Series A devices.
<p>AIX/ESA supports the HYPERchannel Series DX devices.
<p>TCP/IP for VM and TCP/IP for MVS support the HYPERchannel
<a name=index1942>adapter</a> A220, using the 16-bit address mode.

<h3><a name="H800">5.2.1  Addressing Particularities</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1943>Unlike</a> most datagram delivery systems, the
HYPERchannel network message consists of two parts. The first part is a message
header, containing information required for the delivery. The second part is
the associated data.  Its length is literally unlimited. The header consists of
several fields, each of them giving a value for TO and FROM trunks, adapters,
and ports. The corresponding protocol does not support link-level broadcast,
and therefore neither the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) nor the IP
broadcast can be used.
<p>Connected to IBM channels, the entire logical TO field is interpreted as the
subchannel on which the incoming data is to be presented.
