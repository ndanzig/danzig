<h2><a name="H399">4.1  Overview</a>
</h2>

<h3><a name="H400">4.1.1  Characteristics of Applications</a>
</h3>
<p>All of the higher-level protocols have some characteristics in common:
<ul>
<li>They can be user-written applications or applications standardized and
shipped with the TCP/IP product. Indeed, the TCP/IP protocol suite includes
application protocols such as:
<ul>
<li>TELNET for interactive terminal access to remote internet hosts.
<li>FTP (file transfer protocol) for high-speed disk-to-disk file transfers.
<li>SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) as an internet mailing system.
</ul>
These are the most widely implemented application protocols, but a lot of
others exist. Each particular TCP/IP implementation will include a more or less
restricted set of application protocols.
<li>They use either UDP or TCP as a transport mechanism. Remember that UDP is
unreliable and offers no flow-control, so in this case the application has to
provide its own error recovery and flow-control routines. It is often easier to
build applications on top of TCP, a reliable, connection-oriented protocol.
Most application protocols will use TCP, but there are applications built on
UDP to provide better performance through reduced protocol overhead.
<li>Most of them use the client/server model of interaction.
</ul>

<h3><a name="H401">4.1.2  Client/Server Model</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1382>TCP</a> is a peer-to-peer, connection-oriented protocol.
There are no master/slave relations. The applications, however, use a
client/server model for communications.
<p>A <i>server</i> is an application that offers a service to internet users; a
<i>client</i> is a requester of a service. An application consists of both a
server and a client part, which can run on the same or on different systems.
<p>Users usually invoke the client part of the application, which builds a
<i>request</i> for a particular service and sends it to the server part of the
application using TCP/IP as a transport vehicle.
<p>The server is a program that receives a request, performs the required
service and sends back the results in a <i>reply</i>. A server can usually deal
with multiple requests (multiple clients) at the same time.

<br><i>Figure: The Client/Server Model of Applications</i><br><br>
<p>Some servers wait for requests at a <i>well-known port</i> so that their
clients know to which IP socket they must direct their requests. The client
uses an arbitrary port for its communication. Clients that wish to communicate
with a server that does not use a well-known port must have another mechanism
for learning to which port they must address their requests. This mechanism
might employ a registration service such as Portmap, which uses a well-known
port.
<p>The next sections discuss the most widely used application protocols.
