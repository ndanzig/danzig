<br><i>Figure: Packet InterNet Groper (PING)</i><br><br>
<p><a name=index838>Ping</a> is the simplest of all TCP/IP applications. It
sends one or more IP datagrams to a specified destination host requesting a
reply and measures the round trip time. The word <i>ping</i>, which is used as
a noun and a verb, is taken from the sonar operation to locate an underwater
object. It is also an abbreviation for <i>Packet InterNet Groper</i>.
<p>Traditionally, if you could ping a host other applications like Telnet or
FTP could reach that host. With the advent of security measures on the
Internet, particularly firewalls (see
<a href="3376c63.html#firewal">Firewalls</a>), which control access to networks
by application protocol and/or port number, this is no longer strictly true.
Nonetheless, the first test of reachability for a host is still to attempt to
ping it.
<p>The syntax that is used in different implementations of ping varies from
platform to platform. The syntax here is for the OS/2 implementation:
<pre>
ping [-switches] host [size [packets]]
</pre>
Where:
<dl>
<dt>
switches
<dd>Switches to enable various ping options
<dt>
host
<dd>The destination: either a symbolic name or an IP address
<dt>
size
<dd>The size of the data portion of the packet
<dt>
packets
<dd>The number of packets to send
</dl>
<p>Ping uses the ICMP Echo and Echo Reply messages, as described in
<a href="3376c24.html#icmp8">Echo (8) and Echo Reply (0)</a>. Since ICMP is
required in every TCP/IP implementation, hosts do not require a separate server
to respond to pings.
<p>Ping is useful for verifying a TCP/IP installation. Consider the following
four forms of the command; each requires the operation of an additional part of
the TCP/IP installation.
<dl>
<dt>
ping loopback
<dd>Verifies the operation of the base TCP/IP software.
<dt>
ping my-IP-address
<dd>Verifies whether the physical network device can be addressed.
<dt>
ping a-remote-IP-address
<dd>Verifies whether the network can be accessed.
<dt>
ping a-remote-host-name
<dd>Verifies the operation of the name server (or the flat namespace resolver,
depending on the installation).
</dl>
<p>Ping is implemented in all IBM TCP/IP products. TCP/IP for OS/2 (including
the OS/2 Warp LAN Client version) also has a Presentation Manager program
called <a name=index840>PM</a> Ping that uses ping to monitor a user-defined
list of hosts stored in the file \TCPIP\ETC\PINGHOST.LST. This program can be
iconized: when all hosts are responding, the icon is green, but if one or more
hosts do not respond, the icon turns red.
