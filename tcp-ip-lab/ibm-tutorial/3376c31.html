<h2><a name="iprtr">3.1  Basic IP Routing</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1082>The</a> fundamental function for routers is present in
<i>all</i> IP implementations:
<menu>
<li>An <i>incoming</i> IP datagram that specifies a ``destination IP address''
other than the local host's IP address(es), is treated as a normal
<i>outgoing</i> IP datagram.
</menu>
This outgoing IP datagram is subject to the IP routing algorithm of the local
host, which selects the <i>next hop</i> for the datagram (the next host to send
it to). This new destination can be located on any of the physical networks to
which the intermediate host is attached. If it is a physical network other than
the one on which the host originally received the datagram, then the net result
is that the intermediate host has <i>forwarded</i> the IP datagram from one
physical network to another.

implementations.<br><br>
<p>The normal IP routing table contains information about the locally attached
networks and the IP addresses of other routers located on these networks, plus
the networks they attach to. It can be extended with information on IP networks
that are farther away, and can also contain a default route, but it still
remains a table with limited information; that is, it represents only a part of
the whole internet. That is why this kind of router is called a <i>router with
partial routing information</i><a name=index1083>.</a>
<p>Some considerations apply to these routers with partial information:
<ul>
<li>They do not know about all internet networks.
<li>They allow local sites autonomy in establishing and modifying routes.
<li>A routing entry error in one of the routers may introduce inconsistencies,
thereby making part of the network unreachable.
</ul>
<p>Some error reporting should be implemented by routers with partial
information via the Internet Control Message Protocol
<a name=index1084>(ICMP)</a> described in <a href="3376c24.html#icmp">Internet
Control Message Protocol (ICMP)</a>. They should be able to report the
following errors back to the source host:
<ul>
<li>Unknown IP destination network by an ICMP <i>Destination Unreachable</i>
message.
<li>Redirection of traffic to more suitable routers by sending ICMP
<i>Redirect</i> messages.
<li>Congestion problems (too many incoming datagrams for the available buffer
space) by an ICMP <i>Source Quench</i> message.
<li>The ``Time-to-Live'' field of an IP datagram has reached zero. This is
reported with an ICMP <i>Time Exceeded</i> message.
<li>Also, the following base ICMP operations and messages should be supported:
<ul>
<li>Parameter problem
<li>Address mask
<li>Time stamp
<li>Information request/reply
<li>Echo request/reply
</ul>
</ul>
<p>A more intelligent router is required if:
<ul>
<li>The router  has to know routes to <i>all</i> possible IP networks, as was
the case for the ARPANET <i>core</i> gateways.
<li>The router has to have dynamic routing tables, which are kept up-to-date
with minimal or no manual intervention.
<li>The router has to be able to advertise local changes to other routers.
</ul>
<p>These more advanced forms of routers use additional protocols to communicate
with each other. A number of protocols of this kind exist, and descriptions of
the important ones will be given in the following sections. The reasons for
this multiplicity of different protocols are basically fourfold:
<ul>
<li>Using Internet terminology, there is a concept of a group of networks,
called an <i>Autonomous System (AS)</i>, which is administered as a unit. The
AS concept arose because the TCP/IP protocols were developed with the ARPANET
already in place.
<p>Routing within an AS and routing outside an AS are treated as different
issues and are addressed by different protocols.
<li>Over two decades several routing protocols were tested in the Internet.
Some of them performed well, others had to be abandoned.
<li>The emergence of Autonomous Systems of different sizes called for different
routing solutions.  For small to medium sized ASs a group of routing protocols
based upon Distance Vector (RIP, for example) became very popular.  However,
such protocols do not perform well for large interconnected networks.  Link
State protocols like OSPF are much better suited for such networks.
<li>To exchange routing information between ASs border gateway protocols were
developed.
</ul>
<p>Before discussing the various routing protocols, we will review the routing
architectures used in the early Internet, since this will help in understanding
the role played by the differing routing protocols. This overview will also
show the difference between <i>Interior</i> <a name=index1086>and</a>
<i>Exterior</i> routing. We will then discuss the various protocols used for
the two types of routing.

<h3><a name="H321">3.1.1  Routing Daemons</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1092>The</a> routing protocols are often implemented using one
of two daemons: <a href=3376footnotes.html#footnote8>(8)</a>
<dl>
<dt>
routed
<dd>Pronounced ``route D''. This is a basic routing daemon for interior routing
supplied with the majority of TCP/IP implementations. It uses the RIP protocol
(see <a href="3376c33.html#rip">Routing Information Protocol (RIP)</a>).
<dt>
gated
<dd>Pronounced ``gate D''. This is a more sophisticated daemon on UNIX-based
systems for interior and exterior routing. It can employ a number of additional
protocols such as OSPF (see <a href="3376c33.html#ospf">Open Shortest Path
First Protocol (OSPF) Version 2</a>) and BGP (see
<a href="3376c34.html#bgp">Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</a>).
<p>See <a href="3376c34.html#ibmrtr">IP Routing Protocols in IBM TCP/IP
Products</a> for details of routing daemon implementations in IBM products.
