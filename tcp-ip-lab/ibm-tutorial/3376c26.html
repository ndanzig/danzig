<p><a name=index841>The</a> Traceroute program can be useful when used for
debugging purposes. Traceroute enables us to determine the route that IP
datagrams follow from host to host.
<p>Traceroute is based upon ICMP.  It sends an IP datagram with a TTL of 1 to
the destination host.  The first router to see the datagram will decrement the
TTL to 0 and return an ICMP Time Exceeded message as well as discarding the
datagram.  In this way, the first router in the path is identified.  This
process can be repeated with successively larger TTL values in order to
identify the series of routers in the path to the destination host.  Traceroute
actually sends UDP datagrams to the destination host which reference a port
number that is outside the normally used range.  This enables Traceroute to
determine when the destination host has been reached, that is, when an ICMP
Port Unreachable message is received.
<p>Traceroute is implemented in AIX/6000.  It is also implemented in TCP/IP for
OS/2.
