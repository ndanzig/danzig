<h2><a name="nfs">4.12  Network File System (NFS)</a>
</h2>

<br><i>Figure: Network File System (NFS)</i><br><br>
<p>The SUN Microsystems Network File System (NFS) protocol enables machines to
share file systems across a network. The NFS protocol is designed to be
machine-, operating system-, and transport protocol-independent. This is
achieved through implementation <a name=index1756>on</a> top of Remote
Procedure Call (see <a href="3376c410.html#rpc">Remote Procedure Call
(RPC)</a>). RPC establishes machine independence by using the External Data
Representation convention.
<p>SUN-NFS is a <i>proposed standard protocol</i>. Its status is
<i>elective</i>. The current Sun-NFS specification can be found in <i>RFC 1094
- NFS: Network File System Protocol specification</i><a name=index1757>.</a>
This RFC documents NFS Version 2. Although this RFC mentions an NFS Version 3,
nobody has submitted a new RFC nor an Internet-Draft discussing a possible
Version 3 specification.

<h3><a name="H663">4.12.1  Concept</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1758>NFS</a> allows authorized users to access files located on
remote systems as if they were local. Two protocols serve this purpose:
<ol>
<li>The <i>Mount</i> protocol to specify the remote host and file system to be
accessed and where to locate them in the local file hierarchy.
<li>The <i>NFS</i> protocol to do the actual file I/O to the remote file
system.
</ol>
Both Mount and NFS protocol are RPC applications (caller/server concept) and
are <i>transported by UDP</i>.

<h4><a name="H664">4.12.1.1  Mount Protocol</a>
</h4>
<a name=index1759>The</a> Mount protocol is an RPC-application shipped with
NFS. It is program number 100005. The Mount protocol is transported by UDP.
Mount is an RPC-server program and provides a total of six procedures:
<dl>
<dt>
NULL
<dd>Does nothing, useful for server response testing.
<dt>
MOUNT
<dd>Mount function, returns a file handle pointing to the directory.
<dt>
DUMP
<dd>Returns the list of all mounted file systems.
<dt>
UMOUNT
<dd>Removes a mount list entry.
<dt>
UNMTALL
<dd>Removes all mount list entries for this client.
<dt>
EXPORT
<dd>Returns information about the available file systems.
</dl>
The <i>MOUNT</i>-call returns a file handle to the directory. The file handle
is a 32-byte field, which will be used subsequently by the client to access
files. File handles are a fundamental part of NFS because each directory and
file will be referenced through a handle. Some implementations will encrypt the
handles for security reasons (for example, NFS on VM can optionally use the VM
encryption programs to provide this).
<p>The user interface to this RPC application is provided through
<a name=index1761>the</a> MOUNT command. The user issues a MOUNT command to
locate the remote file system in his own file hierarchy.
<p>For example, consider a VM NFS server. The concept of subdirectories
(hierarchical file system) does not exist here; there are only minidisks (to be
considered as one directory each). Now consider an AIX client (AIX does have a
subdirectory file system). The client can access the user 191 VM minidisk as
its local subdirectory /u/vm/first by issuing the MOUNT command:
<pre>
MOUNT -o options
       host:user.191,ro,pass=password,record=type,names=action
       /u/vm/first
</pre>
Where:
<dl>
<dt>
<a name=index1762>options</a>
<dd>System options such as message size.
<dt>
host
<dd>The TCP/IP name of the remote host.
<dt>
user
<dd>VM user ID.
<dt>
191
<dd>Minidisk address.
<dt>
pass=
<dd>Link password that will allow the NFS machine to access the minidisk.
<dt>
record=
<dd>Specifies what translation processing is to be done on the CMS records:
<dl>
<dt>
binary
<dd>No processing performed.
<dt>
text
<dd>Code conversion between EBCDIC (server) and ASCII (client).
<dt>
nl
<dd>EBCDIC-to-ASCII translation, and new line characters are interpreted as CMS
record boundaries.
</dl>
<dt>
names=
<dd>Specifies the handling of a file name:
<dl>
<dt>
fold
<dd>file names supplied by the client are translated to uppercase.
<dt>
mixed
<dd>file names are used as supplied by the client.
</dl>
If no name translation option is specified, case folding is performed and, in
addition, client names that are not valid in CMS will be converted into valid
CMS names.
</dl>
The result is that the VM minidisk is now seen by the client machine as a local
subdirectory:
<br><br><a name=fignfsmou>
<img src="3376f130.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: NFS Mount Command</i> - The client <i>mounts</i> the VM minidisk
user.191 as its local directory <i>/u/vm/first</i>.<br><br>
<p>Obviously, the previous command:
<pre>
MOUNT -o options host:user.191,ro,pass=password,record=type,names=action
/u/vm/first
</pre>
has three parts:
<ol>
<li><tt>-o options</tt> is the <i>client</i> part. It has to be understood by
the NFS client only. This means, it depends on the client host and is
documented in the client's documentation.
<li><tt>host:user.191,ro,....,names=action</tt> is the <i>server</i> part. The
syntax depends on the server's file system (obviously, <tt>user.191</tt> does
not mean anything to an MVS NFS server). Refer to the documentation of the NFS
server to know what parameters it will accept.
<li><tt>/u/vm/first</tt> is a <i>client</i> part and is called the <i>mount
point</i>, that is, where the remote file system will be hooked on the local
file system.
</ol>
<p><a name=index1763>The</a> <i>UMOUNT</i> command removes the remote file
system from the local file hierarchy. Following the example above:
<pre>
UMOUNT /u/vm/first
</pre>
will remove the /u/vm/first directory.

<h4><a name="H666">4.12.1.2  NFS Protocol</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1764>NFS</a> is the RPC application program providing file I/O
functions to a remote host, once it has been requested through a MOUNT command.
It has program number 100003 and sometimes uses IP port 2049. As this is not an
officially assigned port and several versions of NFS (and mount) already exist,
<a name=index1765>port</a> numbers may change. It is advised to go to Portmap
(port number 111) (see <a href="3376c410.html#portmap">Portmap or
Portmapper</a>) to obtain the port numbers for both Mount and NFS. The NFS
protocol is transported by UDP.
<p>The NFS program supports 18 procedures, providing for all basic I/O
operations such as:
<dl>
<dt>
LOOKUP
<dd>Searches for a file in the current directory and if found, returns a file
handle pointing to it plus information on the file's attributes.
<dt>
READ and WRITE
<dd>Basic read/write primitives to access the file.
<dt>
RENAME
<dd>Renames a file.
<dt>
REMOVE
<dd>Deletes a file.
<dt>
MKDIR and RMDIR
<dd>Creation/deletion of subdirectories.
<dt>
GET and SET-ATTR
<dd>Gets or sets file attributes.
</dl>
Other functions are also provided.
<p>These correspond to most of the file I/O primitives used in the local
operating system to access local files. In fact, once the remote directory is
mounted, the local operating system just has to "re-route" the file I/O
primitives to the remote host. This makes all file I/Os look alike, regardless
of whether the file is located locally or remotely. The user can operate his
normal commands and programs on both kinds of files; in other words, this
<i>NFS protocol is completely transparent to the user</i>.  See
<a href="3376c412.html#fignfsio">Figure - NFS File I/O</a>.
<br><br><a name=fignfsio>
<img src="3376f131.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: NFS File I/O</i> - Intercepted at the operating system level,
thereby making it transparent to the user.<br><br>

<h4><a name="H668">4.12.1.3  NFS File System</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1766>NFS</a> assumes a hierarchical file system (directories).
Files are unstructured streams of uninterpreted bytes; that is, files are seen
as a contiguous byte stream, without any record-level structure.
<p>This is the kind of file system used by AIX and PC/DOS, so these
environments will easily integrate an NFS-client extension in their own local
file system. File systems used in VM and MVS lend themselves less readily to
this kind of extension.
<p>With NFS, all file operations are <i>synchronous</i>. This means that the
file-operation call only returns when the server has completed all work for
this operation. In case of a write request, the server will physically write
the data to disk and if necessary, update any directory structure, before
returning a response to the client. This ensures file integrity.
<p>NFS also specifies that servers should be <i>stateless</i>. That is, a
server does not need to maintain any extra information about any of its clients
in order to function correctly. In case of a server failure, clients only have
to retry a request until the server responds, without having to reiterate a
mount operation.

<h3><a name="H669">4.12.2  Implementations</a>
</h3>

<h4><a name="H670">4.12.2.1  VM</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1767>TCP/IP</a> for VM includes the NFS server function only.
This means that other hosts running NFS will be able to access VM minidisks,
but that the VM user is not able to access the remote hosts' file systems.
<p>The VM NFS server uses UDP port number 2049. It also requires that the
PORTMAP virtual machine be started.
<p>The VM NFS server saves information about the file handles it distributes to
clients in the file <i>VMNFS HISTORY</i>. This is done because the 32-byte file
handle cannot hold all information needed to uniquely identify a CMS file. So,
instead, each file handle is associated with a record of the history file. The
<i>VMNFS HISTORY</i> will also record the CP LINK password the client sends
when he wants to access a minidisk. Appropriate actions should be taken to
ensure security of this file (on NFS 191 disk).
<p>To prevent a client from manipulating the contents of an obtained file
handle, provision is made for encryption of these file handles. The client must
return this encrypted file handle for each file operation. The <i>NFSFHCIP
ASSEMBLE</i> file is shipped with the product. It invokes a subroutine to
encode or decode a file handle. As shipped, it will call the <i>Information
Protection System Cryptographic Programs for VM/CMS</i>, program number
5796-PPK. This file should be modified to contain the cryptographic key needed
for the encryption. By changing the assembly source, one may also call upon
other cryptographic programs, or not use any encoding at all. The <i>VMNFS
MODULE</i> will need to be rebuilt only if some form of encryption is used. See
<i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2 Release 3 for VM: Planning and Customization</i> for
more information on encryption and for other installation parameters.
<p>Another security feature for the VM NFS implementation is the possibility to
send the CP LINK password (sent by client to the server) separately from the
MOUNT command, because all the information transmitted with the MOUNT command
(passwords for example) are stored on the client. This is provided through the
MOUNT -v or MOUNTPW commands.
<p>If RACF is installed on your server, it can be used to secure the access to
the minidisks. Please refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2 Release 3 for VM:
Planning and Customization</i> for more details.
<p>The VM NFS server uses, when possible, the multiple-block *BLOCKIO, a fast
VM Control Program system service, to improve the write operations.
<p>The SMSG command allows an authorized user to transmit commands to NFS while
NFS is executing. For example, displaying a summary of its activity, detaching
a mounted minidisk, writing internal trace table to disk, or refreshing a
mounted minidisk.
<p>The following shows a sample output from a query command.
<br><br><a name=fig>
<pre>
<b>SMSG VMNFS M QUERY</b>

MSG FROM VMNFS   : M   1 mount, 0 mountpw, 0 mountnull, 0 unmount, 0 unsupported
MSG FROM VMNFS   : M End of reply.
</pre>
<br><br><br>
<p>The <tt>SHOWEXP</tt> command is not supported. That is, you cannot display
from a client the <i>export list</i> (the minidisks that can be mounted) of a
VM NFS server.
<p>An alternative NFS implementation for the VM/ESA environment is LAN File
Services/ESA.

<h4><a name="H672">4.12.2.2  MVS</a>
</h4>
<p>NFS in the MVS environment is delivered as part of Data Facility Systems
Managed Storage/MVS (DFSMS/MVS). NFS in the MVS environment supports the server
function only.
<p>It provides access to data sets for users of workstations which support the
NFS client function. NFS uses the MVS access methods to read, write, create or
delete MVS data sets.
<p>The NFS server reads or writes binary and text data. In a file that contains
text, record boundaries are translated into line terminators. A file that
contains binary data is stored in the MVS system and retrieved without text
translation.
<p>In order to get access to the NFS server, an NFS client will be required to
submit a user ID and password.  This security function is provided by PCNFSD.
PCNFSD replaces the <i>mvslogin</i> and <i>mvslogout</i> commands which
performed a similar function in earlier MVS NFS implementations.
<p>Unlike VM, the <tt>SHOWEXP</tt> command is supported.
<p>An alternative NFS implementation for the MVS/ESA environment is LAN File
Services/ESA.
<p>With LFS/ESA on MVS, an NFS client is able to access OpenEdition MVS
Hierarchical File System (HFS) files on MVS.

<h4><a name="H673">4.12.2.3  OS/400</a>
</h4>
<p>NFS for OS/400 is available by installing the TCP/IP File Server
Support/400. This product allows other systems to access AS/400 system files
(both Native Database and Shared Folder).
<p>TCP/IP File Server Support/400 is a server only implementation of NFS.
<p>TCP/IP File Server Support/400 supports NFS Protocol Version 2. TCP/IP File
Server Support is designed to be compatible with clients running ONC/NFS
Version 4.x.
<p>NFS support (NFS/400) will be integrated into OS/400 in 1995.  The new NFS
support will provide both client and server capability and will be compatible
with SUN Microsystems NFS.

<h4><a name="H674">4.12.2.4  AIX/6000</a>
</h4>
<p>NFS on RISC System/6000 supports:
<ul>
<li>Server and client functions
<li>Network Information Services (NIS)
<li>Network Lock Manager and Status Monitor
<li>Automounter support
<li>Diskless support (Sun diskless booting from RISC System/6000)
<li>User authentication provided via RPC's use of Data Encryption Standard
(DES)
<li>XDR library routines
<li>Support for PC-NFS V4.0 (Sun System on PC)
<li>Support of Access Control Lists between AIX/6000 systems
<li>Remote mapped file support, which allows a RS/6000 NFS client to take
advantage of the enhanced virtual memory management function of AIX/6000
<li>Kernel extension support, which allows users to install NFS without
rebuilding the base AIX kernel
<li>System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) support designed to provide an
easy-to-use menu/dialog user interface for NFS configuration and management
<li>System Resource Control (SRC) support designed to provide an easy-to-use
and consistent way to start and stop the NFS daemons
</ul>
<p>Information about NFS on all AIX implementations has been collected in the
publication: <i>AIX Distributed Environments</i>, GG24-3489.

<h4><a name="H675">4.12.2.5  AIX/ESA</a>
</h4>
<p><i>NFS for IBM AIX/ESA Version 2 Release 1</i> supports:
<ul>
<li>Server and client functions
<li>Network information services (NIS)
<li>Network Lock Manager and Status Monitor
<li>XDR library routines
</ul>
It is compliant with SUN NFS Version 2.

<h4><a name="H676">4.12.2.6  OS/2</a>
</h4>
<p>TCP/IP for OS/2 includes the NFS client and server functions.
<p>The client runs in the <i>NFSCTL</i> program. The following commands are
shipped with the product:
<ul>
<li><tt>NFSC</tt>: to start the client NFSCTL.
<li><tt>MOUNT</tt>: to mount a directory on an NFS server as a local drive. It
takes advantage of PCNFSD if it is available on the UNIX server (this prevents
you from having to remember your UIDs and GIDs on each of the UNIX machines to
which you have access). If PCNFSD is not running, <tt>MOUNT</tt> will prompt
you for a UID and GID (if you did not supply them on the command line). You can
use different UIDs and GIDs for different servers.
<li><tt>UMOUNT</tt>: to dismount previously mounted NFS drives.
<li><tt>MVSLOGIN</tt>: to authenticate an NFS client's access to a data set on
a specific MVS server.
<li><tt>MVSLOGUT</tt>: to end the session with an MVS NFS server.
<li><tt>QMOUNT</tt>: to query the characteristics of a drive.
<li><tt>UNIX2OS2</tt>: to convert text files from the UNIX format (lines end in
a <i>line-feed (LF)</i> character only) to OS/2 format (lines end in a
<i>carriage-return line-feed (CRLF)</i> sequence).
<li><tt>OS22UNIX</tt>: to convert from the OS/2 format to the UNIX format.
<li><tt>NFSDIR</tt>: to quickly display a directory from an NFS mounted drive.
<li><tt>SHOWEXP</tt>: to display a list of exported file systems for a specific
host running an NFS server.
<li><tt>LN</tt>: to create symbolic links on an NFS mounted drive.
</ul>
<p>The OS/2 NFS server is started by the <tt>NFSD</tt> command. It requires
Portmap to be started via the <tt>PORTMAP</tt> command. It also requires the
\ETC\EXPORTS file which is read only during NFSD startup. Please refer to
<i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2.0 for OS/2: Installation and Administration</i> for
more considerations about the \ETC\EXPORTS file.
<p>PCNFSD support is provided in the OS/2 NFS Server.

<h4><a name="H677">4.12.2.7  DOS</a>
</h4>
<p>TCP/IP for DOS includes the NFS client function only. Both native DOS and
Microsoft Windows implementations are provided in a separately orderable kit.
<p>The following commands are available:
<ul>
<li><tt>MOUNT</tt>: to mount a directory on an NFS server as a local drive. It
takes advantage of PCNFSD if it is available on the UNIX server (this prevents
you from having to remember your UIDs and GIDs on each of the UNIX machines on
which you have access). If PCNFSD is not running, <tt>MOUNT</tt> will prompt
you for a UID and GID (if you did not supply them on the command line).
<li><tt>MVSLOGIN</tt>: to authenticate an NFS client's access to an MVS NFS
server.
<hr><strong>**** NOTE: ****</strong>
The MVS NFS server requires that uid and gid be set to -2. Before using the
MOUNT or MVSLOGIN commands, either issue the following two commands or put them
in the CONFIG.SYS file: <br>
       set unix.uid=-2<br>
       set unix.gid=-2<br>
<hr>
<li><tt>MVSLOGUT</tt>: to end the session with an MVS NFS server.
<li><tt>QMOUNT</tt>: to display a list of mounted drives.
<li><tt>SHOMOUNT</tt>: to display the list of clients who currently have a
directory mounted on an NFS server.
<li><tt>SHOWEXP</tt>: to display the list of exported file systems available
for mounting for a specific host running an NFS server (if supported by the
server).
<li><tt>UMOUNT</tt>: to dismount previously mounted drives.
<li><tt>TODOS</tt>: to convert text files from the UNIX format (lines end in a
<i>line-feed (LF)</i> character only) to DOS format (lines end in a
<i>carriage-return line-feed (CR LF)</i> two-character sequence).
<li><tt>TOUNIX</tt>: to convert from the DOS format to the UNIX format.
<li><tt>NFSDOWN</tt>: to shut down and remove the DOSNFS TSR from memory.
<li><tt>NFSPRINT</tt>: to allow spooling and printing files with NFS. Two
servers participate in the print-spool services: the PCNFSD server, and the
print server. These servers can run on the same machine, but this is not
necessary.
<li><tt>NFSSET</tt>: If the NFS server is a UNIX host, when a file is created
in a mounted file system it has a <i>umask</i> assigned to it, which indicates
the file permissions associated with it. By default, all files created on a
mounted drive have a umask of 600, which means that the owner of these files
has the ability to read and write to them, and no one else can access them. The
NFSSET command allows you to change the umask (3-digit octal number that
indicates how the user, the members of the user's group, and the other system
users can access the file. The default is 600 (which means that the owner of
the file has the ability to read and write to it, and no one else has access to
them).  The flash variable default is OFF (if set to ON the scroll light is
flashed whenever a mounted file system is accessed).
<li><tt>NFSPING</tt>: To check the status of an NFS server (different daemons
can be <i>pinged</i> such as PCNFSD, the MOUNT daemon, and the NFS daemon).
<li><tt>NFSSTAT</tt>: To display the status of NFS, including the umask and the
current status of the flash variable.
</ul>
<p>Please refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2.1.1 for DOS: User's Guide</i> for
more details about the NFS commands.
