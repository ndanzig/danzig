<h2><a name="other">4.23  Other Application Protocols</a>
</h2>
<p>There are a number of other application protocols which are not documented
in the RFCs, but are implemented by various products. The following sections
describe some of these protocols.

<h3><a name="ndb">4.23.1  Network Database (NDB)</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1923>The</a> Network Database (NDB) protocol is not an Internet
standard.
<p>NDB defines a protocol for use with relational database systems in a TCP/IP
environment. It has the following objectives:
<ul>
<li>To allow any workstation/mainframe users and applications to issue SQL
statements interactively or imbedded within the application programs, to access
any database on any operating system.
<li>To distribute the applications of a database host to a requester machine.
</ul>
<p>NDB is built on the Remote Procedure Call (any arbitrary implementation of
RPC) using the client/server model. Please see
<a href="3376c423.html#figndbfig">Figure - Components in the Network Database
(NDB) Protocol</a> for an overview of the various NDB components.

<br><i>Figure: Components in the Network Database (NDB) Protocol</i><br><br>
<dl>
<dt>
1 The <b>RPC client/server</b> layer
<dd>is concerned with the transport of data across the TCP/IP network: creating
sockets, interfacing with PORTMAP, sending and receiving data.
<dt>
2 The <b>NetDB client/server</b> layer
<dd>manages Units of Work(UOWs), multi-threading, and also data conversion
to/from the ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation 1, ISO standard 8824) format.
<dt>
3 The <b>DB Utility</b> layer
<dd>serves as the interface to the actual database.
</dl>

<h4><a name="H777">4.23.1.1  Implementations</a>
</h4>
<p>The TCP/IP for MVS and TCP/IP for VM both implement a NDB server and provide
sample NDB client source code for AIX/6000 and SUN workstations. The supported
database products are DB2 in MVS and SQL/DS in VM.
<p>The current VM server implementation only supports the SQL SELECT DML
function.
<p>The current MVS server implementation supports all SQL statements that can
be dynamically prepared in an MVS DB2 environment.
<p>For details on the NDB implementations, please refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP
Version 3 Release 1 for MVS: Customization and Administration Guide</i> and
<i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2 Release 3 for VM: Planning and Customization</i>.

<h3><a name="nis">4.23.2  Network Information Systems (NIS)</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1926>The</a> Network Information Systems (NIS) is not an
Internet standard. It was developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.  It was
originally known as the Yellow Pages.
<p>NIS is a distributed database system which allows the sharing of system
information in an AIX- or UNIX-based environment. Examples of system
information that can be shared include the /etc/passwd, /etc/group and
/etc/hosts files. NIS has the following advantages:
<ul>
<li>Provides a consistent user ID and group ID name space across a large number
of systems.
<li>Reduces the time and effort by users in managing their user IDs, group IDs
and NFS file system ownerships.
<li>Reduces the time and effort by system administrators in managing user IDs,
group IDs and NFS file system ownerships.
</ul>
<p>NIS is built on the SUN-RPC. It employs the client/server model. An NIS
domain is a collection of systems consisting of:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>NIS master server</b>
<dd>maintains <i>maps</i>, or databases, containing the system information such
as passwords and host names.
<dt>
<b>NIS slave server(s)</b>
<dd>can be defined to offload the processing from the master NIS server or when
the NIS master server is unavailable.
<dt>
<b>NIS client(s)</b>
<dd>are the remaining systems which are served by the NIS servers.
</dl>
The NIS clients do not maintain NIS maps; they query NIS servers for system
information. Any changes to an NIS map is done only to the NIS master server
(via RPC). The master server then propagates the changes to the NIS slave
servers.
<p>Note that the speed of a network determines the performance and availability
of the NIS maps. When using NIS, the number of slave servers should be tuned in
order to achieve these goals.

<h4><a name="H779">4.23.2.1  Implementations</a>
</h4>
<p>AIX/6000 and AIX/ESA Version 2 all support NIS.
<p>Note that the AIX/ESA implementation is provided by the licensed program
<i>Network File System For AIX/ESA Version 2</i>. In all implementations, NFS
must be configured before using NIS.

<h3><a name="cicssoc">4.23.3  CICS Socket Interface</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1928>Customer</a> Information Control System (CICS) is a
high-performance transaction-processing system. It is developed by IBM and has
product implementations in MVS/ESA, MVS, VSE, OS/400, OS/2, AIX/6000.
<p>CICS is the most widely used OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) system in
the marketplace today. It provides a rich set of CICS <i>command level</i> APIs
to the application transaction programs for data communications (using SNA) and
database (using VSAM, IMS or DB2).
<p>Given the need for interoperability among heterogeneous network protocols,
there is a requirement to enhance the CICS data communications interface to
include support for TCP/IP in addition to SNA. The <i>IBM Sockets Interface for
CICS</i> is a first step towards addressing this requirement.

<h4><a name="H781">4.23.3.1  Implementations</a>
</h4>
<p>TCP/IP for MVS implements the <i>IBM Socket Interface for CICS</i>. Both
CICS/MVS Version 2 and CICS/ESA Version 3 are supported.
<p>The support provides a sockets environment to any C, COBOL, PL/I or
Assembler language programs running under CICS, for communications with any
sockets application programs running in any (local or foreign) systems. The
interface is implemented, in CICS terms, using a CICS <i>Task Related User Exit
(TRUE)</i>. (This is similar to the TRUE implementation of the CICS-DB2 SQL
interface.)
<p>For details on the IBM Socket Interface for CICS, please refer to <i>IBM
Sockets Interface for CICS-Using TCP/IP Version 3 Release 1 for MVS: User's
Guide</i>.

<h3><a name="imssoc">4.23.4  IMS Socket Interface</a>
</h3>
<p>The IMS Socket Interface is implemented in TCP/IP for MVS Version 3.1 only.
<p>The IMS to TCP/IP sockets interface allows you to develop IMS message
processing programs which can conduct a conversation with peer programs in
other TCP/IP hosts. The applications may be either client or server
applications. The IMS to TCP/IP sockets interface includes socket interfaces
for IBM C/370, assembler language, COBOL, and PL/I languages to use stream
(connection oriented) sockets. It also provides ASCII-EBCDIC conversion
routines, an ASSIST module which permits the use of conventional IMS calls for
TCP/IP communications, and a Listener function to listen for and accept
connection requests and start the appropriate IMS transaction to service those
requests.
<p>For details on the IBM Socket Interface for IMS, please refer to <i>IBM
Sockets Interface for CICS-Using TCP/IP Version 3 Release 1 for MVS: User's
Guide</i>.

<h3><a name="socex">4.23.5  Sockets Extended</a>
</h3>
<p>The Sockets Extended information described here is related to the
implementation in MVS only.
<p>Sockets Extended provides programmers writing in assembler language, COBOL,
or PL/I with an application program interface that may be used to conduct
peer-to-peer conversations with other hosts in the TCP/IP networks. You can
develop applications for TSO, batch, CICS, or IMS using this API. The
applications may be designed to be reentrant and multithreaded depending upon
the application requirements. Typically server applications will be
multithreaded while client applications may not be.
<p>For details on the IBM Sockets Extended for MVS TCP/IP, please refer to
<i>IBM Sockets Interface for CICS-Using TCP/IP Version 3 Release 1 for MVS:
User's Guide</i>.

<h3><a name="rexxsoc">4.23.6  REXX Sockets</a>
</h3>
<p>REXX sockets allow you to develop REXX applications that communicate over a
TCP/IP network. Calls are provided to initialize sockets, exchange data via
sockets, perform management activities, and close the sockets.
<p>The REXX Socket APIs are implemented in TCP/IP for MVS and OS/2.

<h3><a name="rfc1006">4.23.7  RFC 1006</a>
</h3>
<p>Programs that were originally written to the X/Open Transport Interface
(XTI) may be used with the TCP/IP stack. RFC 1006 defines a protocol mapping
component to enable these programs to be used in a TCP/IP network.
<p>The RFC 1006 is implemented in the following IBM products:
<ul>
<li>IBM TCP/IP Version 3 Release 1 for MVS
<li>AIX OSI Services/6000
<li>IBM AIX Distributed Computing Environment Global Directory Services Version
1.1 for AIX/6000
<li>VERITAS for IBM AIX/ESA
<li>IBM AIX Distributed Computing Environment/ESA
</ul>
