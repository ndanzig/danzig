<h2><a name="routhis">3.2  Historical Perspective</a>
</h2>
<p>Initially, the ARPANET (see <a href="3376c12.html#arpanet">ARPANET</a>)
played a central role in the development of the Internet, particularly in the
area of routing. Although it was replaced in its role as the backbone of the
Internet by the NSFNET in the late 1980s, the experience gained from its
routing architecture had a direct effect on the later development of the
current set of routing protocols.

<h3><a name="arparte">3.2.1  The ARPANET Routing Architecture</a>
</h3>
<p>At its heart was the concept of an <i>Autonomous System (AS)</i>: a
collection of networks controlled by a single authority. Each AS is registered
with the NIC (now the InterNIC) and has a 16-bit identification number called
the <i>autonomous system number</i> or <i>AS number</i>. These are listed in
<i>RFC 1166 - Internet Numbers</i>. The ARPANET core system was itself
considered an autonomous system.

<br><i>Figure: The ARPANET Backbone</i> - The terms in the diagram are
explained in the text which follows.<br><br>
<p>In keeping with the nomenclature used at the time, we shall refer to the
routers between Autonomous Systems as <i>gateways</i>. All routing between
gateways can be categorized as <i>intra-AS</i> <a name=index1095>(also</a>
termed <i>Interior</i>) if the gateways belong to the same AS or
<i>inter-AS</i> <a name=index1097>(also</a> termed <i>Exterior</i>) if they
belong to different ones.
<p>Intra-AS routing uses an <i>Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)</i>
<a name=index1098>and</a> inter-AS routing uses an <i>Exterior Gateway Protocol
(EGP)</i><a name=index1099>.</a> The ARPANET architecture did not specify which
protocol should be used as an IGP, but it did specify a protocol to be used as
an EGP. Confusingly, this protocol was also named <i>Exterior Gateway
Protocol</i><a name=index1100>.</a>
<p><b>Note:</b> To avoid confusion, we shall use the term ``EGP'' to refer
specifically to the EGP protocol, and ``an EGP'' to refer to a protocol
belonging to the EGP group of protocols.

<h4><a name="cncore">3.2.1.1  Core and Non-Core Gateways</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1101>In</a> the ARPANET system, the <i>core gateways</i> which
made up the backbone were maintained by a central authority, the
<a name=index1102>Internet</a> Network Operations Center. They provided
reliable and authoritative routes for <i>all</i> possible Internet networks,
and connected the ARPANET to the other Internet networks.
<p>The core gateways (shown as CGx, CGy and so on in
<a href="3376c32.html#figarpacor">Figure - The ARPANET Backbone</a>) had to
know about all possible destinations in order to optimize the ARPANET traffic.
A datagram travelling from one local network to another via the core system
passed through exactly two core gateways. The ARPANET routing architecture
specified that the core gateways communicated with the <i>Gateway-to-Gateway
Protocol (GGP)</i>.
<p><i>Non-core gateways</i> <a name=index1103>(shown</a> as <tt>G</tt> in
<a href="3376c32.html#figarpacor">Figure - The ARPANET Backbone</a>) were
maintained by the organizations responsible for the individual Autonomous
Systems and forwarded information about networks in their areas to the core
gateways using EGP.

<h4><a name="H327">3.2.1.2  Core Gateways</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1104>In</a> addition to the simple ICMP error-reporting
messages, an ARPANET core gateway also implemented:
<ul>
<li>Gateway-to-Gateway Protocol (GGP) <a name=index1105>to</a> exchange
connectivity information between core gateways (see
<a href="3376c32.html#ggp">Gateway-to-Gateway Protocol (GGP)</a>).
<li>Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) <a name=index1106>to</a> collect
connectivity information from non-core gateways (see
<a href="3376c34.html#egp">Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)</a>).
<li>Cross-Network Debugging Protocol (XNET), <a name=index1107>used</a> to load
the gateway and to create and examine the gateway's data.
<li>Host Monitoring Protocol (HMP) <a name=index1111>used</a> to collect
measurements and statistics information from the gateways (RFC 869).
</ul>

<h4><a name="H328">3.2.1.3  Non-Core Gateways</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1112>Local</a> internetworks created by individual groups can
span multiple physical networks, tied together through gateways (non-core
gateways). <a name=index1113>Such</a> a group of networks is called an
<i>autonomous system</i> (AS). Among its responsibilities, an AS must:
<ul>
<li>Collect reachability information for all of its connected networks.
<li>Advertise reachability information to the core system using a standard
protocol.
<li>Have a single administrative and technical point of contact.
</ul>
<p>An autonomous system must collect routing and reachability information about
its own internal networks. Selected machines must forward that information to
other autonomous systems and to the core gateways. As noted above, EGP must be
used for this inter-AS communication.  For inter-AS communication any suitable
IGP may be used, the two most common being:
<ul>
<li><a name=index1114>The</a> Hello protocol described in
<a href="3376c33.html#hello">The Hello Protocol</a>
<li><a name=index1115>Routing</a> Information Protocol (RIP) described in
<a href="3376c33.html#rip1">Routing Information Protocol Version 1 (RIP,
RIP-1)</a>
</ul>

<h4><a name="ggp">3.2.1.4  Gateway-to-Gateway Protocol (GGP)</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1116>GGP</a> is an <i>historic protocol</i>. Its status is
<i>not recommended</i>. It is described in detail in <i>RFC 823 - The DARPA
Internet Gateway</i><a name=index1117>.</a>
<p>As mentioned previously (see <a href="3376c32.html#cncore">Core and Non-Core
Gateways</a>), the original ARPANET core gateways used the
<i>Gateway-to-Gateway Protocol</i>, to exchange routing information.  In
addition to this role, it had to route datagrams that were passing through the
core system. Any datagram in transit through the core system should pass
through two core gateways. The basic principles of GGP follow:
<p>When a core gateway comes up, it is assigned core <i>neighbors</i>. A
gateway only needs to propagate information about the networks it can reach to
its neighbors. The neighbors will update their routing information with the
received information and will send the changes to their assigned neighbors.
<p>The information consists of sets (N,C) where:
<dl>
<dt>
N
<dd>is a network that is reachable by this gateway
<dt>
C
<dd>is the cost of reaching that network. The cost is expressed in gateway hops
(number of gateways to pass). A cost of zero corresponds to a network that is
directly attached to the core gateway. Maximum cost corresponds to unreachable
networks.
</dl>
<p>GGP messages are carried in IP datagrams, and typically contain a list of
(N,C) pairs. They are sent by a gateway to its neighbors whenever one of the
following occurs:
<ul>
<li>A new network becomes reachable from the gateway.
<li>A network becomes unreachable.
<li>Routing data is changed due to reception of GGP messages from neighbor
gateways.
</ul>
<p>Upon receipt of a GGP message from gateway G, the neighbor gateway A will
compare an incoming (N,C) pair to the (N,C) pair in its local tables. If the
cost to reach network N would be smaller by using the gateway G (originator of
the GGP message) than when using the routing information in the local table,
the routing path for network N is updated to point to gateway G, and as this is
a route change, the gateway A will generate a GGP message to inform its
neighbors of the change. Eventually, the information on network N will reach
all the core gateways.

<h3><a name="H330">3.2.2  NSFNET Routing Architecture</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1119>As</a> described in
<a href="3376c12.html#nsfnet">NSFNET</a>, the NSFNET backbone has been
implemented in three phases and its routing architecture and protocols have
evolved accordingly. This evolution and possible future alternatives are
described in detail in:
<ul>
<li><i>RFC 1074 - The NSFNET Backbone SPF Based Interior Gateway
Protocol</i><a name=index1120>.</a>
<li><i>RFC 1092 - EGP and Policy Based Routing in the New NSFNET
Backbone</i><a name=index1121>.</a>
<li><i>RFC 1093 - The NSFNET Routing Architecture</i><a name=index1122>.</a>
<li><i>RFC 1104 - Models of Policy Based Routing</i><a name=index1123>.</a>
<li><i>RFC 1133 - Routing between the NSFNET and the
DDN</i><a name=index1124>.</a>
<li><i>RFC 1222 - Advancing the NSFNET Routing
Architecture</i><a name=index1125>.</a>
</ul>
<p>The <b>first backbone</b> used the Hello protocol (see
<a href="3376c33.html#hello">The Hello Protocol</a>) for interior routing. The
client networks were mostly using RIP (see <a href="3376c33.html#rip1">Routing
Information Protocol Version 1 (RIP, RIP-1)</a>) as an IGP and they were
connected to the backbone using a <i>gated</i> <a name=index1127>interface</a>
which acted as an interface between the Hello and RIP protocols.
<p>The <b>second backbone</b> used a subset of the ANSI OSI Intermediate System
to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol (see
<a href="3376c33.html#isis">OSI Intermediate System to Intermediate System
(IS-IS)</a>) as an IGP. It used EGP (see <a href="3376c34.html#egp">Exterior
Gateway Protocol (EGP)</a>) to exchange reachability information between the
backbone and the attached mid-level and peer networks. The routing is
controlled <a name=index1128>by</a> a distributed <i>routing policy
database</i> that controls the acceptance and distribution of routing
information. This database is managed by the Network Operations Center and is
available through Information Services.
<p>In the <b>third backbone</b>, EGP was progressively replaced by a true
inter-AS routing protocol called the <i>Border Gateway Protocol
(BGP)</i><a name=index1129>,</a> described in <a href="3376c34.html#bgp">Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP)</a>. One important aspect of BGP is its treatment of the
Internet as an arbitrarily connected set of autonomous systems with no single
core system. This removes the requirement for a single network such as NSFNET
to play a central role and allows the backbone to be composed of many peer
networks.
