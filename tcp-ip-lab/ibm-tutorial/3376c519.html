<h2><a name="hubs">5.19  The IBM Hubs Family</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index2013>Basically</a> a hub is a wiring concentrator which
connects the participating LAN workstations in a star-wired cabling system.
Therefore a hub is mostly located in the wiring closet or near the workgroups.
Today the term hub is used to describe multiprotocol devices offering
sophisticated network management features and great flexibility for
configuration.
<p>One of the trends in networking is the move to centralize network functions
in the wiring closet. This goes along with the trend toward collapsed
backbones. A collapsed backbone uses the intelligent hub as the network
backbone rather than using a segment of cable. Thus the backbone of the network
is collapsed into the intelligent hub. This allows the network administrator to
consolidate many network functions into a fault tolerant intelligent hub.
<p>Hubs have been used in networks for wiring concentration for many years.
Early hubs were passive devices that only provided for network connection such
as the 8228. New hubs are becoming more sophisticated and they can do much more
than act as wiring concentrators.
<p>The following network functions can be consolidated in the intelligent hub:
<ul>
<li>Port concentration
<li>Software bank and port switching - you can switch a user or a group of
users from one network to another through software which saves time when making
changes in the network
<li>Network management
<li>Terminal attachment - there are modules for attaching asynchronous
terminals and 3270 terminals
<li>Bridging (SRB, TB, SRT, Translational Bridging)
<li>Switching - similar to bridging but faster
</ul>
<p>IBM offers a large variety of hub products to build a secure, reliable and
manageable LAN. Hubs can be divided into two major groups: the first group,
which supports only one specific LAN protocol token-ring or FDDI (workgroup
hubs) for example, and the second which supports multiple LAN protocols in a
single box (intelligent hubs). In this section you get a brief description of
the different available hubs and the major information from a TCP/IP point of
view.

<h3><a name="8230">5.19.1  IBM 8230 Token-Ring Controlled Access Unit</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index2014>The</a> IBM 8230 is an intelligent token-ring network
wiring concentrator, providing enhanced levels of control and reliability over
passive token-ring network wiring concentrators, such as the IBM 8228.
<p>The 8230 is a rack mountable device that:
<ul>
<li>Supports ring operation at 4 and 16 Mbps
<li>Is able to function as a repeater in both ring directions (on main and
backup path)
<li>Has pluggable ring-in and ring-out modules to support copper and fiber
cable
<li>Has token-ring MAC appearances on both the main and backup ring path
<li>May have its microcode loaded from the IBM LAN Network Manager, or from a
diagnostic utility, which is provided
<li>The IBM 8230 supports  the IBM LAN Network Manager over CMOL by:
<ul>
<li>Maintaining the IBM LAN Network Manager's configuration table
<li>Providing access control by reporting station insertions
<li>Asset control in conjunction with IBM LAN Network Manager
</ul>
<li>With the new Models 003 and 013 you have the ability to select either the
CMOL or the SNMP management option with a switch on the front panel. There is a
Product Specific Module (PSM) provided in order to manage this device
graphically from NetView for Windows.
<li>The SNMP agent supports the following functions:
<ul>
<li>MIB II
<li>Enterprise-specific MIB
<li>Trap sending
<li>GET/SET ability to enable/disable ports etc.
</ul>
<p>All SNMP setup is done via the out-of-band management port (RS-232).
<p>The microcode update is done over TFTP.
<p>The CMOL management provides the same functionality.
</ul>
<p>For further information please refer to <i>IBM 8230 Model 3 Planning
Guide</i>.

<h3><a name="8222">5.19.2  IBM 8222 Workgroup Hub</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index2018>The</a> IBM 8222 offers low-cost attachment for six
10Base-T nodes and has no in- or out-of-band network management. One of the six
ports can be used to cascade to another 10BaseT concentrator when expansion is
needed. Its suitable environment could be in small offices, using either
permanently installed UTP or short lengths of UTP between devices that are in
close proximity to one another. However, the modular expandability of Ethernet
and relatively easy connection to the earlier bus topologies allow the IBM 8222
to be used as part of larger, even establishment-wide, LANs.
<p>For further information please refer to <i>IBM 6-Port 10Base-T Workgroup Hub
Installation &amp; Planning Guide</i>.

<h3><a name="8224">5.19.3  IBM 8224 Ethernet Stackable Hub</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index2023>The</a> 8224 is IBM's newest Ethernet/802.3 hub. It
provides low cost connectivity for 10Base-T networks.  It can be managed
through SNMP and it can connect to existing 10Base-5, 10Base-2, 10Base-T, and
fiber networks.
<p>The 8224 is a stackable, SNMP manageable Ethernet hub for 10Base-T networks.
The following is a list of 8224 features:
<ul>
<li>16 10Base-T ports
<li>Up to 10 8224s in a stack
<li>Model 2 is SNMP manageable
<p>Supported are RFC 1213 MIB II, RFC 1516 Hub Repeater MIB for 802.3 and
Novell Repeater MIB. The SNMP agent uses either IP or IPX as a networking
protocol. Therefore the 8224 can be managed with an SNMP manager or Novell's
NetWare Management Station. There is a Product Specific Module (PSM) available
to manage this hub graphically from the IBM NetView for Windows application.
<li>Up to 9 8224 Model 1s can be managed by a Model 2
<li>Optional media expansion port to attach to 10Base-2, 10Base-5, fiber
<li>A stack of 8224s can be segmented into separate Ethernet segments
</ul>
<p>For further information please refer to <i>IBM 8224 Ethernet Stackable Hub
Installation and User' Guide</i>.

<h3><a name="8244">5.19.4  IBM 8244 FDDI Workgroup Concentrator</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index2028>The</a> IBM 8244 Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
Workgroup Concentrator is the primary attachment to the FDDI dual ring for
attaching workstations to the backbone. The 8244 FDDI concentrator allows
attaching up to 12 devices to a 100 Mbps network. These devices may be
connected via:
<ul>
<li>Multimode optical fiber, or
<li>IBM Cabling System's shielded twisted pair (STP) copper cable, or
<li>Unshielded twisted pair (UTP-5) copper cable
</ul>
<p>The 8244 can provide connection for FDDI devices that are based on the ANSI
and ISO standards. The 8244 will operate with management entities that support
the ANSI Station Management (SMT) 7.3 frame-based protocols.
<p>Concentrator management is made possible via the imbedded FDDI SNMP agent.
This agent will maintain the concentrator's FDDI MIB for SMT 7.3 (RFC 1512) and
MIB II (RFC 1213) parameters for use by NetView for AIX or any original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) SNMP-based network management system.
<p>Network management is further enhanced by use of the complementary FDDI SNMP
Proxy Agent on the OS/2 platform. This agent will convert SMT to SNMP protocols
for use by NetView for AIX or any OEM SNMP-based network management system.
<p>For further information please refer to <i>IBM 8244 FDDI Workgroup
Concentrator: User' Guide</i>.

<h3><a name="8250">5.19.5  IBM 8250 Multiprotocol Intelligent Hub</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index2031>The</a> IBM 8250 Multiprotocol Intelligent Hub is a family
of products designed to provide the platform to build LANs meeting the
requirements of customers using various types of cabling systems (such as STP,
UTP, fiber and coax) and different types of LANs (such as token-ring, Ethernet,
and FDDI).
<p>The 8250 family consists of four models of rack-mountable chassis, each
offering an advanced backplane architecture, which allows the concurrent
operation of several LANs using various LAN protocols. A range of media and
management modules are also provided to allow the design of networks addressing
the individual needs of each organization.
<p>8250 modules can be added, removed or reconfigured while the 8250 is in
operation. This allows changes to the configuration of the network without
affecting the operation of the other users on the network.
<p>For management purposes you need at least one management module per hub.
This module can be one of the available management modules, a basic token-ring
management module for example. Each of these modules includes a media access
adapter, depending on the type of module, for in-band management and a RS-232
interface for out-of-band management. The module also includes the SNMP agent
function with MIB II and a specific 8250 MIB and a TELNET server for remote
configuration. The management module has access to all other modules residing
in the same hub via the management bus on the backplane. This gives you the
ability to change the port assignments for example of a token-ring media module
from an Ethernet management module without the need to buy a protocol specific
management module for each supported protocol in the hub. Of course you won't
get any media specific statistics or failures from another segment or LAN type.
<p>The microcode update can be done by TFTP.
<p>Management can be simplified by using the graphical application <i>IBM
Intelligent Hub Manager for AIX</i>.
<p>The newest 8250 MIB is available from the anonymous FTP server:
ftp://venera.isi.edu/mib on the Internet.

Intelligent Hub and IBM 8260 Multiprotocol Intelligent Switching Hub Planning
and Site Preparation Guide</i>.

<h3><a name="8260">5.19.6  IBM 8260 Multiprotocol Intelligent Hub</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index2037>The</a> 8260 is IBM's newest intelligent hub. It is a hub
platform for enterprise networking with an option of ATM for future growth. It
can use existing 8250 modules so customers who have invested in 8250s can move
to the 8260 without discarding their modules.
<p>It can be used as a data center hub for consolidation of enterprise network
functions. It also can be used as a wiring closet hub for port concentration
and management.
<p>It has all the features of the 8250 and the following new features:
<ul>
<li>Increased LAN capacity
<li>Power supply load sharing for increased fault tolerance
<li>Distributed management architecture
<li>ATM upgrade option
<li>ATM media modules
</ul>
<p>The management of the 8260 hub is similar to the 8250 but more flexible. You
can manage multiple LAN segments concurrently with only one management module
because of the distributed architecture. The SNMP agent with the MIB II, the
8260 specific MIB, the TELNET server and all the IP functionality resides in
the Distributed Management Module (DMM). The media access is provided by Media
Access Cards (MAC) which can reside either as daughter cards directly on the
media module or on the DMM carrier module. With this architecture you can
"watch" up to 6 segments with only one DMM card. This saves space for other
media modules and increases the maximum port density.
<p>Management can be simplified by using the graphical application <i>IBM
Intelligent Hub Manager for AIX</i>.
<p>ATM management
<p>The 8260 Switch/Control Point Module implements an SNMP ATM agent that
includes objects defined by the standards bodies, as well as IBM specific
extensions for superior manageability  of  ATM networks from the network
management station
<p>This SNMP agent features the following functions:
<ul>
<li>Full SNMP support (get, getnext, set and traps) allowing complete control
and monitoring through SNMP commands
<li>Support of IP over ATM (RFC 1577) for node management and services. Network
management stations can therefore contact the switch/control point module agent
either through direct connection to the ATM network using IP over ATM, or
connected to a traditional LAN that is routed to the ATM subnetwork
<li>MIB 2 support
<li>Full ILMI <a href=3376footnotes.html#footnote23>(23)</a>(ATM Forum V3.0)
support (at UNI <a href=3376footnotes.html#footnote24>(24)</a>and from network
management station)
<li>IETF AToMIB, allowing the network administrator to display the status and
configuration of 8260 ATM interfaces, including active VPCs and VCCs.
Statistics on ATM interfaces are also collected via this MIB
<li>MIB support for topology and route computation management, allowing the
display from the central management station of the topology of the 8260 network
and the set of attached ATM stations
<li>IBM-specific extensions
</ul>
<p>With the graphical application <i>IBM ATM Campus Manager for AIX</i> the
management is greatly simplified.
<p>The newest 8260 MIB is available from the anonymous FTP server:
<i>ftp://venera.isi.edu/mib</i> on the Internet.
