<h2><a name="H834">5.12  3174 Establishment Controller</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1981>The</a> IBM 3174 Establishment Controller Configuration
Support-C Release 6 provides TCP/IP TELNET client support, to communicate with
TCP/IP TELNET servers via its token-ring interface, for the following attached
devices:
<ul>
<li>3270 CUT-mode terminals and ASCII display stations
<li>intelligent workstations coaxially attached (installed with either OS/2
with TCP/IP for OS/2, or DOS with TCP/IP for DOS and the IBM Workstation Peer
Communication Support Program)
</ul>
The TELNET hosts (servers) may be attached directly to the same token-ring
which the 3174 is connected to, or they may exist anywhere in the network
reachable via that token-ring and any bridges or routers. These TELNET hosts
can also be non-IBM hosts that provide TELNET server support.

<h4><a name="H835">5.12.0.1  3174 Supported TELNET Terminal Types</a>
</h4>
<p>For the coaxially attached display terminals, the 3174 supports the
following 24x80 full-screen terminal types: IBM3101, DEC VT100, DEC VT220 and
Data General D210.
<p>For the ASCII-Emulation Adapter-attached ASCII display terminals, the 3174
passes the terminal data stream transparently to the TELNET server. This means
that the TELNET server manages the display terminal as if it were a locally
attached ASCII terminal.
<p>The TELNET line mode is also supported for all displays.
<p>In addition, TN3270 protocol support and Ethernet connectivity support are
provided. TN3270 support allows the 3174 to support 3270 data stream traffic
across TCP/IP links.
<p>LPD and LPR printing functions are also supported.
