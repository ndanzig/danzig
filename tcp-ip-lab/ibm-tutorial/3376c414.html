<br><i>Figure: Network Management</i><br><br>
<p>With the growth in size and complexity of the TCP/IP-based internets the
need for network management became very important. The current network
management framework for TCP/IP-based internets consists of:
<ol>
<li>SMI (RFC 1155) - describes how managed objects contained in the MIB are
defined. (It will be discussed in <a href="3376c414.html#smi">Structure and
Identification of Management Information (SMI)</a>.)
<li>MIB-II (RFC 1213) - describes the managed objects contained in the MIB. (It
will be discussed in <a href="3376c414.html#mib">Management Information Base
(MIB)</a>.)
<li>SNMP (RFC 1098) - defines the protocol used to manage these objects. (It
will be discussed in <a href="3376c414.html#snmp">Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP)</a>.)
</ol>
The Internet Architecture Board issued an RFC detailing its recommendation,
which adopted two different approaches:
<ul>
<li>In the short term SNMP should be used.
<p>The IAB recommends that all IP and TCP implementations be network
manageable.  At the current time, this implies implementation of the Internet
MIB-II (RFC 1213), and at least the recommended management protocol SNMP (RFC
1157).
<p>Note that the historic protocols <a name=index1795>SGMP</a> (<i>Simple
Gateway Monitoring Protocol</i>, RFC 1028) and MIB-I (RFC-1156) are not
recommended for use.
<li>In the long term, use of the emerging OSI network management
<a name=index1798>protocol</a> (CMIP) would be investigated. This is known as
<i>CMIP over TCP/IP</i> <a name=index1801>(CMOT).</a> (It will be discussed in
<a href="3376c414.html#cmot">Common Management Information Protocol over TCP/IP
(CMOT)</a>.)
</ul>
<p>Both the SNMP and CMOT use the same basic concepts in describing and
defining management information called <i>Structure and Identification of
Management Information</i> (SMI) described in RFC 1155 and <i>Management
Information Base</i> (MIB) described in RFC 1156.

<h3><a name="smi">4.14.2  Structure and Identification of Management
Information (SMI)</a>
</h3>
<a name=index1803>The</a> SMI defines the rules for how managed objects are
described and how management protocols may access these objects. The
description of managed objects is made using a subset of the ASN.1 (Abstract
Syntax Notation 1, ISO standard 8824), a <a name=index1808>data</a> description
language. The object type definition consists of five fields:
<ul>
<li>Object: A textual name, termed the <i>object descriptor</i>, for the object
type along with its corresponding <i>object identifier</i> defined below.
<li>Syntax: The abstract syntax for the object type. It can be a choice of
SimpleSyntax (Integer, Octet String, Object Identifier, Null) or an
ApplicationSyntax (NetworkAddress, Counter, Gauge, TimeTicks, Opaque) or other
application-wide types (see RFC 1155 for more details).
<li>Definition: A textual description of the semantics of the object type.
<li>Access: One of read-only, read-write, write-only or not-accessible.
<li>Status: One of mandatory, optional, or obsolete.
</ul>
<p>As an example, we can have:
<br><br><img src="3376f135.gif"><br><br>
<p>This example shows the definition of an object contained in the Management
Information Base (MIB). Its name is sysDescr and it belongs to the system group
(see <a href="3376c414.html#mib">Management Information Base (MIB)</a>).
<p><a name=index1813>A</a> managed object not only has to be described but
identified, too. This is done using the ASN.1 Object Identifier in the same way
as a telephone number, reserving group of numbers to different locations. In
the case of TCP/IP-based network management the number allocated was 1.3.6.1.2
and SMI uses it as the base for defining new objects.
<p>The number 1.3.6.1.2 is obtained by joining groups of numbers with the
following meaning:
<ul>
<li>The first group defines the node administrator:
<ul>
<li>(1) for ISO
<li>(2) for CCITT
<li>(3) for the joint ISO-CCITT.
</ul>
<li>The second group for the ISO node administrator defines (3) for use by
other organizations.
<li>The third group defines (6) for the use of the U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD).
<li>In the forth group the DoD has not indicated how it will manage its group
so the Internet community assumed (1) for its own.
<li>The fifth group was approved by IAB to be:
<ul>
<li>(1) for the use of OSI directory in the Internet
<li>(2) for objects identification for management purposes
<li>(3) for objects identification for experimental purposes
<li>(4) for objects identification for private use.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>In the example the {system 1} beside the object name means that the object
identifier is 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1. It is the first object in the first group
(system) in the Management Information Base (MIB).

</h3>

<h4><a name="H699">4.14.3.1  Overview</a>
</h4>
<a name=index1814>The</a> MIB defines the objects which may be managed for each
layer in the TCP/IP protocol. There are two versions, MIB-I and MIB-II. MIB-I
was defined in RFC 1156, and is now classified as a <i>historic</i> protocol
with a status of <i>not recommended</i>.
<br><br><a name=figmibii>
<img src="3376f136.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: Management Information Base II (MIB-II)</i> - Group
definition.<br><br>
<p><a name=index1815>Each</a> managed node supports only those groups that are
appropriate. For example, if there is no gateway, the EGP group need not be
supported. But if a group is appropriate, all objects in that group must be
supported.
<p>The list of managed objects defined has been derived from those elements
considered essential. This approach of taking only the essential objects is not
restrictive, since the SMI provides extensibility mechanisms like definition of
a new version of the MIB and definition of private or non-standard objects.
<p>Below are some examples of objects in each group. The complete list
<a name=index1816>is</a> defined in RFC 1213.

</ul>
</ul>
<p>This is not the complete MIB definition but it is presented as an example of
the objects defined in each group.
<p>To illustrate this, the Interfaces Group contains two top-level objects: the
number of interface attachments on the node (<i>ifNumber</i>) and a table
containing information on those interfaces (<i>ifTable</i>). Each entry
(<i>ifEntry</i>) in that table contains the objects for a particular interface.
Among those, the interface type (<i>ifType</i>) is identified in the MIB tree
using the ASN.1 notation by 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3. and for a token-ring adapter
the value of the corresponding variable would be 9, which means
"iso88025-tokenRing" (see <a href="3376c414.html#figsmi">Figure - Object
Identifier</a>).

<h3><a name="snmp">4.14.4  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)</a>
</h3>
The SNMP added the improvement of many years of experience in SGMP and allowed
it to work with the objects defined in the MIB with the representation defined
in the SIM.
<p><a name=index1819>RFC</a> 1157 defines <a name=index1820>the</a> Network
Management Station (NMS) as the one that executes <a name=index1823>network</a>
management applications (NMA) that monitor <a name=index1826>and</a> control
network elements (NE) such as hosts, gateways and terminal servers. These
network elements <a name=index1832>use</a> a management agent (MA) to perform
the network management functions requested by the network management stations.
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to communicate management
information between the network management stations and the agents in the
network elements.
<br><br><a name=figsnmp>
<img src="3376f138.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: SNMP</i> - Components of the Simple Network Management
Protocol.<br><br>
<p><a name=index1835>All</a> the management agent functions are only
alterations (set) or inspections (get) of variables limiting the number of
essential management functions to two and avoiding more complex protocols. In
the other direction, from NE to NMS, a limited number of unsolicited messages
(traps) are used to inform about asynchronous events. In the same way, trying
to preserve the simplicity, the interchange of information requires only an
unreliable datagram service and every message is entirely and independently
represented by a single transport datagram. This means also that the mechanisms
of the SNMP are generally suitable for use with a wide variety of transport
services. The RFC 1157 specifies the exchange of messages via the UDP protocol,
but a wide variety of transport protocols can be used.
<p>The entities residing at management stations and network elements that
communicate with one another using the SNMP are termed SNMP application
entities. The peer processes that implement it are the protocol entities. An
SNMP agent with some arbitrary set of SNMP application entities is called an
SNMP community, where each one is named by a string of octets that need to be
unique only to the agent participating in the community.
<p>A message in the SNMP protocol consists of a version identifier,
<a name=index1837>an</a> SNMP community name and a protocol data unit (PDU). It
is mandatory that all implementations of the SNMP support the five PDUs:
<ul>
<li><b>GetRequest</b>: Retrieve the values of a specific object from the MIB
<li><b>GetNextRequest</b>: Walk through portions of the MIB
<li><b>SetRequest</b>: Alter the values of a specific object from the MIB
<li><b>GetResponse</b>: Response from a GetRequest, a GetNextRequest and a
SetRequest
<li><b>Trap</b>: Capability of the network elements to generate events to
network management stations such as agent initialization, agent restart and
link failure. There are seven trap types defined in RFC 1157: coldStart,
warmStart, linkDown, linkUp, authenticationFailure, egpNeighborLoss and
enterpriseSpecific.
</ul>
<p>The formats of these messages are as follows:

<h3><a name="cmot">4.14.5  Common Management Information Protocol over TCP/IP
(CMOT)</a>
</h3>
<a name=index1838>CMOT</a> is the network management architecture that has been
developed to move towards a closer relationship <a name=index1839>with</a> the
Open System Interconnection (OSI) network management standards named Common
Management Information Protocol (CMIP). With these premises CMOT, as in the OSI
model, can be divided into an organizational model, functional model and
informational model.
<p>In the organizational and informational models the same OSI concept is used
in CMOT and in SNMP. The object identification is formed using the subtree
related to the DoD with subdivisions in management, directory, experimental and
private. All the management objects are defined in the Management Information
Base (MIB) being represented by the Structure and Identification of Management
Information (SMI), a subset of the ASN.1 (OSI Abstract Syntax Notation 1).
<p>In the functional model CMOT adopted the OSI model that divides the
management components into managers and agents. The agent collects information,
performs commands and executes tests and the manager receives data, generates
commands and sends instructions to the agents. This manager and agent are
formed by a set of specific management <a name=index1843>information</a> per
communication layer named the Layer Management Entities (LME).
<br><br><a name=figcmot1>
<img src="3376f140.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: CMOT</i> - Components of the CMIP over TCP/IP.<br><br>
<p><a name=index1848>All</a> the LME are coordinated by a System Management
Application Process (SMAP) that can communicate between different systems over
the Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP).
<p>In the OSI approach the management can occur only over fully established
connections between the managers and the agents. CMOT allows management
information exchange over connectionless services (datagram). But to maintain
the same service interface required by CMIP, called
<a name=index1852>Common</a> Management Information Services (CMIS), the CMOT
architecture defined a new communication layer, the
<a name=index1856>Lightweight</a> Presentation Protocol (LPP). This layer has
been defined to provide the presentation services required for the CMIP so that
the entirely defined network management standards defined by OSI will fit in
the TCP/IP CMOT architecture.

<h3><a name="H709">4.14.6  SNMP Distributed Programming Interface (SNMP
DPI)</a>
</h3>
<p>SNMP defines a protocol that permits operations on a collection of
variables. This set of variables (MIB) and a core set of variables have
previously been defined. However, the design of the MIB makes provision for
extension of this core set. Unfortunately, conventional SNMP agent
implementations provide no means for an end user to make new variables
available. The SNMP DPI addresses this issue by providing a light-weight
mechanism that permits end users to dynamically add, delete, or replace
management variables in the local MIB without requiring recompilation of the
SNMP agent. This is achieved by writing the so-called subagent that
communicates with the agent via the SNMP DPI. It is described by G. Carpenter
and B. Wijnen (T.J. Watson Research Center, IBM Corp.) in RFC 1228.
<p><a name=index1861>The</a> SNMP DPI allows a process to register the
existence of a MIB variable with the SNMP agent. When requests for the variable
are received by the SNMP agent, it will pass the query on to the process acting
as  a subagent. This subagent then returns an appropriate answer to the SNMP
agent. The SNMP agent eventually packages an SNMP response packet and sends the
answer back to the remote network management station that initiated the
request. None of the remote network management stations have any knowledge that
the SNMP agent calls on other processes to obtain an answer.
<p><a name=index1862>Communication</a> between the SNMP agent and its clients
(subagents) takes place over a stream connection. This is typically a TCP
connection, but other stream-oriented transport mechanisms can be used (as an
example, the VM SNMP agent allows DPI connections over IUCV).
<p>The SNMP Agent DPI can:
<ul>
<li>Create and delete subtrees in the MIB
<li>Create a register request packet for the subagent to inform the SNMP agent
<li>Create response packet for the subagent to answer the SNMP agent's request
<li>Create a TRAP request packet.
</ul>
<p>The following figure shows the flow between an SNMP agent and a subagent.
<br><br><a name=fig>

<br><i>Figure: SNMP DPI Overview</i><br><br>
<ul>
<li><a name=index1863>The</a> SNMP agent communicates with the SNMP manager via
the SNMP protocol.
<li>The SNMP agent communicates with the TCP/IP layers and kernel (OS) in an
implementation-dependent manner. It potentially implements the standard MIB
view in this way.
<li>An SNMP subagent, running as a separate process (potentially even on
another machine), can register objects with the SNMP agent (<tt>Register</tt>).
<li>The SNMP agent will decode SNMP packets. If such a packet contains a
Get/GetNext or Set request for an object registered by the subagent, it will
send the request to the subagent via the corresponding query packet (<tt>MIB
query</tt>).
<li>The SNMP sub-agent send responses back via a RESPONSE packet
(<tt>Reply</tt>).
<li>The SNMP agent then encodes the reply into an SNMP packet and sends it back
to the requesting SNMP manager.
<li>If the subagent wants to report an important state change, it sends a Trap
packet to the SNMP agent, which will encode it into an SNMP trap and send it to
the manager(s).
</ul>

(SNMPv2)</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index1864>The</a> framework of version 2 of the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMPv2) was published in April 1993 and consists of 12
RFCs including the first, RFC 1441, which is an introduction. In August 1993
all 12 RFCs became a proposed standard with the status elective.
<p>This framework consists of the following disciplines:

modules. Description in RFC 1443.
<li>Protocol operations
<p>Definition of protocol operations with respect to the sending and receiving
of PDUs. Description in RFC 1448.
<li>Transport mappings
<p>Definition of mapping SNMPv2 onto an initial set of transport domains
because it may be used over a variety of protocol suites. The mapping onto UDP
is the preferred mapping. The RFC also defines OSI, AppleTalk, IPX etc.
Description in RFC 1449.

<p>The following sections describe the major differences and improvements from
SNMPv1 to SNMPv2.

<h4><a name="snmpent">4.14.7.1  SNMPv2 Entity</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1868>An</a> SNMPv2 entity is an actual process which performs
network management operations by generating and/or responding to SNMPv2
protocol messages by using the SNMPv2 protocol operations. All possible
operations of an Entity can be restricted to a subset of all possible
operations that belong to a particular administratively defined Party. Please
refer to <a href="3376c414.html#snmppar">SNMPv2 Party</a> below. An SNMPv2
Entity could be member of multiple SNMPv2 Parties. The following local
databases are maintained by an SNMPv2 Entity:
<ul>
<li>One database for all Parties known by the SNMPv2 Entity which could be:
<ul>
<li>Operation realized locally
<li>Operation realized by proxy interactions with remote Parties or devices
<li>Operation realized by other SNMPv2 Entities
</ul>
<li>Another database that represents all managed object resources which are
known to that SNMPv2 entity.
<li>And at least a database that represents an access control policy that
defines the access privileges accorded to known SNMPv2 parties
</ul>
An SNMPv2 Entity can act as an SNMPv2 agent or manager.

<h4><a name="snmppar">4.14.7.2  SNMPv2 Party</a>
</h4>
<a name=index1870>An</a> SNMPv2 party is a conceptual, virtual execution
environment whose operation is restricted, for security or other purposes, to
an administratively defined subset of all possible operations of a particular
SNMPv2 entity. Please refer to <a href="3376c414.html#snmpent">SNMPv2
Entity</a> above. Architecturally, each SNMPv2 party comprises:
<ul>
<li>A single, unique party identity
<li>A logical network location at which the party executes, characterized by a
transport protocol domain and transport addressing information
<li>A single authentication protocol and associated parameters by which all
protocol messages originated by the party are authenticated as to origin and
integrity
<li>A single privacy protocol and associated parameters by which all protocol
messages received by the party are protected from disclosure
</ul>

<h4><a name="getbulk">4.14.7.3  GetBulkRequest</a>

<p><a name=index1872>The</a> GetBulkRequest is defined in RFC 1448 and is thus
part of the protocol operations. A GetBulkRequest is generated and transmitted
as a request of an SNMPv2 application. The purpose of the GetBulkRequest is to
request the  transfer of a potentially large amount of data, including, but not
limited to, the efficient and rapid retrieval of large tables. The
GetBulkRequest is more efficient than the GetNextRequest in case of retrieval
of large MIB object tables. The syntax of the GetBulkRequest is:
<pre>
GetBulkRequest [ non-repeaters = N, max-repetitions = M ]
                ( RequestedObjectName1,
                  RequestedObjectName2,
                  RequestedObjectName3 )
</pre>
Where:
<dl>
<dt>
RequestedObjectName1, 2, 3
<dd>MIB object identifier like sysUpTime etc. The objects are in a
lexicographically ordered list. Each object identifier has a binding to at
least one variable. For example, the object identifier
<i>ipNetToMediaPhysAddress</i> has a variable binding for each IP address in
the ARP table and the content is the associated MAC address.
<dt>
N
<dd>Specifies the non-repeaters value, which means that you request only the
contents, of the variable next to the object specified in your request, of the
first N objects named between the parentheses. This is the same function as
provided by the GetNextRequest.
<dt>
M
<dd>Specifies the max-repetitions value, which means that you request from the
remaining (number of requested objects - N) objects the contents of the M
variables next to your object specified in the request. Similar to an iterated
GetNextRequest but transmitted in only one request.
</dl>
With the GetBulkRequest you can efficiently get the contents of only the next
variable or the next M variables in only one request.
<p>Assume the following ARP table in a host which runs an SNMPv2 agent:
<pre>
Interface-Number  Network-Address  Physical-Address  Type

       1            10.0.0.51     00:00:10:01:23:45  static
       1             9.2.3.4      00:00:10:54:32:10  dynamic
       2            10.0.0.15     00:00:10:98:76:54  dynamic
</pre>
An SNMPv2 manager sends the following request to retrieve the sysUpTime and the
complete ARP table:
<pre>
GetBulkRequest [ non-repeaters = 1, max-repetitions = 2 ]
                ( sysUpTime,
                  ipNetToMediaPhysAddress,
                  ipNetToMediaType )
</pre>
The SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent role responds with a Response-PDU:
<pre>
Response (( sysUpTime.0 =  "123456" ),
          ( ipNetToMediaPhysAddress.1.9.2.3.4 =
                                     "000010543210" ),
          ( ipNetToMediaType.1.9.2.3.4 =  "dynamic" ),
          ( ipNetToMediaPhysAddress.1.10.0.0.51 =
                                      "000010012345" ),
          ( ipNetToMediaType.1.10.0.0.51 =  "static" ))
</pre>
The SNMPv2 entity acting in a manager role continues with:
<pre>
GetBulkRequest [ non-repeaters = 1, max-repetitions = 2 ]
                ( sysUpTime,
                  ipNetToMediaPhysAddress.1.10.0.0.51,
                  ipNetToMediaType.1.10.0.0.51 )
</pre>
The SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent role responds with:
<pre>
Response (( sysUpTime.0 =  "123466" ),
          ( ipNetToMediaPhysAddress.2.10.0.0.15 =
                                     "000010987654" ),
          ( ipNetToMediaType.2.10.0.0.15 =
                                          "dynamic" ),
          ( ipNetToMediaNetAddress.1.9.2.3.4 =
                                          "9.2.3.4" ),
          ( ipRoutingDiscards.0 =  "2" ))
</pre>
This response signals the end of the table to the SNMPv2  entity acting in a
manager role. With the GetNextRequest you would have needed four requests to
retrieve the same information. If you had set the <i>max-repetition</i> value
of the GetBulkRequest to three, in this example, you would have needed only one
request.

<h4><a name="H715">4.14.7.4  InformRequest</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1873>An</a> InformRequest is generated and transmitted as a
request from an application in an SNMPv2 manager entity that wishes to notify
another application, acting also in an SNMPv2 manager entity, of information in
the MIB view <a href=3376footnotes.html#footnote20>(20)</a>of a party local to
the sending application. The packet is used as an indicative assertion to the
manager of another party about information accessible to the originating party
(manager-to-manager communication across party boundaries). The first two
variables in the variable binding list of an InformRequest are sysUpTime.0 and
snmpEventID.i <a href=3376footnotes.html#footnote21>(21)</a>respectively. Other
variables may follow.

<h3><a name="H718">4.14.8  MIB for SNMPv2</a>
</h3>
<p>This MIB defines managed objects which describe the behavior of the SNMPv2
entity.
<p><b>Note:</b> This is not a replacement of the MIB-II.
<p>Following are some object definitions to get an idea of the contents:
<pre>
snmpORLastChange OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     TimeStamp
    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The value of sysUpTime at the time of the most
            recent change in state or value of any instance of
            snmpORID."

warmStart NOTIFICATION-TYPE
    STATUS  current
    DESCRIPTION
            "A warmStart trap signifies that the SNMPv2
            entity, acting in an agent role, is reinitializing
            itself such that its configuration is unaltered."
</pre>

<h3><a name="H719">4.14.9  Party MIB</a>
</h3>
<p>The party MIB defines managed objects which correspond to the properties
associated with an SNMPv2 party. An example of some MIB objects:
<pre>
partyIdentity OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      Party
    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "A party identifier uniquely identifying a

    DESCRIPTION
            "The authentication protocol by which all messages
            generated by the party are authenticated as to
            origin and integrity.  The value noAuth signifies
            that messages generated by the party are not
            authenticated.

            Once an instance of this object is created, its
            value can not be changed."
</pre>

<h4><a name="H720">4.14.9.1  Manager-to-Manager MIB</a>
</h4>
<p><a name=index1874>The</a> purpose of this MIB is to provide the means for
coordination between multiple management stations. That is, the means by which
the controlling and monitoring functions of network management can be
distributed amongst multiple management stations in a large network.
Specifically, this MIB provides the means for one management station to request
management services from another management station. Therefore, an SNMPv2
entity can act in a dual role; when providing management information to another
manager the entity acts as an agent, and when requesting information, it acts
as a manager. The manager-to-manager MIB consists of the following three
tables:
<ul>
<li>Alarms
<li>Events
<li>Notifications
</ul>
Each alarm is a specific condition detected through the periodic, at a
configured sampling interval, monitoring of the value of a specific management
information variable. An example of an alarm condition is when the monitored
variable falls outside a configured range. Each alarm condition triggers an
event and each event can cause (one or more) notifications to be reported to
other management stations using the InformRequest frame.

<h3><a name="H721">4.14.10  Single Authentication and Privacy Protocol</a>
</h3>
<p>The authentication protocol provides a mechanism by which SNMPv2 management
communications, transmitted by a party, may be reliably identified as having
originated from that party.
<p>The privacy protocol provides a mechanism by which SNMPv2 management
communications, transmitted to a party, are protected from disclosure.
<p>Principal threats against which the SNMPv2 security protocol provides
protection are:
<ul>
<li>Modification of information
<li>Masquerade
<li>Message stream modification
<li>Disclosure
</ul>
The following security services provide protection against the above threats:
<ul>
<li>Data integrity
<p>Provided by the MD5 message digest algorithm. A 128-bit digest is calculated
over the designated portion of a SNMPv2 message and included as part of the
message sent to the recipient.
<li>Data origin authentication
<p>Provided by prefixing each message with a secret value shared by the
originator of that message and its intended recipient before digesting.
<li>Message delay or replay
<p>Provided by including a timestamp value in each message.
<li>Data confidentiality
<p>Provided by the symmetric privacy protocol which encrypts an appropriate
portion of the message according to a secret key known only to the originator
and recipient of the message. This protocol is used in conjunction with the
symmetric encryption algorithm, in the cipher block chaining mode, which is
part of the Data Encryption Standard (DES). The designated portion of an SNMPv2
message is encrypted and included as part of the message sent to the recipient.
</ul>

<h3><a name="H722">4.14.11  The New Administrative Model</a>
</h3>
<p>It is the purpose of the Administrative Model for SNMPv2, to define how the
administrative framework is applied to  realize effective network management in
a variety of configurations and environments.
<p>The model entails the use of distinct identities for peers that exchange
SNMPv2 messages. Thus, it represents a departure from the community-based
administrative model of the original SNMPv1. By unambiguously identifying the
source and intended recipient of each SNMPv2 message, this new strategy
improves upon the historical community scheme both by supporting a more
convenient access control model and allowing for effective use of asymmetric
(public key) security protocols in the future. Please refer to
<a href="3376c414.html#figsnmpv2">Figure - SNMP Version 2 Message Format</a>
for the new message format.
<br><br><a name=figsnmpv2>
<img src="3376f143.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: SNMP Version 2 Message Format</i><br><br>
<dl>
<dt>
PDU
<dd>Includes one of the following Protocol Data Units:
<ul>
<li>GetRequest
<li>GetNextRequest
<li>Response
<li>SetRequest
<li>InformRequest
<li>SNMPv2-Trap
</ul>
The GetBulkRequest has a different PDU format as shown above. Please also refer
to <a href="3376c414.html#getbulk">GetBulkRequest</a>.
<p><b>Note:</b> The SNMP-Trap now has the same format as all the other
requests.
<dt>
SnmpMgmtCom (SNMP Management Communication)
<dd>Adds the source party ID (srcParty), the destination party ID (dstParty)
and the context to the PDU. The context specifies the SNMPv2 context containing
the management information referenced by the communication.
<dt>
SnmpAuthMsg
<dd>This field is used as authentication information from the authentication
protocol used by that party. The SnmpAuthMsg is serialized according to ASN.1
BER <a href=3376footnotes.html#footnote22>(22)</a>and can then be encrypted.
<dt>
SnmpPrivMsg SNMP Private Message
<dd>An SNMPv2 Private Message is an SNMPv2 authenticated management
communication that is (possibly) protected from disclosure. A private
destination (privDst) is added to address the destination party.
</dl>
The message is then encapsulated in a normal UDP/IP datagram and sent to the
destination across the network.
<p>For further information please refer to the above mentioned RFCs.

<h3><a name="H725">4.14.12  Implementations</a>
</h3>
<p><b>Note:</b> <a name=index1875>The</a> implementations described below only
refer to the SNMP version 1.

<h4><a name="H726">4.14.12.1  VM and MVS</a>
</h4>
<p>The TCP/IP for VM and MVS products provide both an SNMP client and an SNMP
agent. They support the following MIB-II groups: system, interfaces, address
translation, ip, icmp, tcp, udp and the IBM 3172 Enterprise Specific. Although
no Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) is currently available under MVS or VM, you
can query, from a VM or MVS manager, an agent that supports EGP. Of course a VM
or an MVS agent will not be able to create EGP traps. The TCP/IP for VM and MVS
products do not support the Set-Request PDU.
<p>The traps generated by the SNMP agent (VM or MVS) are:
<ul>
<li>COLD_START: signifies that the agent is reinitializing itself.
<li>AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE: signifies that an invalid community name has been
provided from a manager within a GET PDU, for example.
<li>LINK_UP: signifies that the sending protocol entity recognizes that one of
its communication links represented in the agent's configuration has come up.
<li>LINK_DOWN: signifies that the sending protocol entity recognizes a failure
in one of its communication links represented in the agent's configuration.
</ul>
<p>The SNMP Agent DPI is also implemented under VM and MVS. This DPI allows
external processes to generate SNMP traps.
<p>The SNMP agent is provided within the SNMPD (<i>Simple Network Management
Daemon</i>) Virtual Machine (VM) or Address Space (MVS).
<p>The SNMP manager function requires that both NetView and the SNMPQE
(<i>Simple Network Management Query Engine</i>) be up and running.
<br><br><a name=fignetmng2>
<img src="3376f144.gif"></a>
<br><i>Figure: Overview of NetView SNMP Support</i><br><br>
<p><a name=index1876>A</a> description of the operation of the interface
between TCP/IP and SNMP/NetView follows:
<ol>
<li>NetView operator or CLIST issues an SNMP command.
<li>SNMP command is validated by SNMP Command Processor.
<li>SNMP Command Processor passes the request to SNMPIUCV task.
<li>SNMPIUCV task passes the request to SNMP Query Engine (SNMPQE).
<li>SNMP Query Engine validates and encodes the request in ASN.1 and SNMP PDU
(using the <i>tcpip</i>.MIB@DESC.DATA MVS data set or the MIB_DESC DATA VM
file) and sends it to SNMP agent (variables must always be in ASN.1 notation
when they are sent to an SNMP agent).
<li>SNMP Query Engine receives a response from the SNMP agent.
<li>SNMP Query Engine decodes the response and sends it to the NetView SNMPIUCV
task.
<li>SNMPIUCV task sends the response as a multi-line message to the requesting
operator or authorized receiver.
</ol>
<p>To avoid unnecessary network traffic, each variable described in the
customizable file, "MIB_DESC DATA" in VM or "<i>tcpip</i>.MIB@DESC.DATA" in
MVS, has a <i>Time To Live (TTL)</i> value assigned. This specifies the number
of seconds that the variable <i>lives</i> in <a name=index1877>the</a> Query
Engine's internal cache. The value is obtained from the cache if multiple
requests for the same variable are issued within the TTL period.
<p>IBM 3172 support:
<p>IBM TCP/IP supports <i>SNMP GET</i> and <i>SNMP GETNEXT</i> operations to
request and retrieve the IBM 3172 enterprise-specific MIB variables. These
requests will only be answered by those IBM 3172 devices connected to the MVS
host's TCP/IP and whose <i>DEVICE</i> definition in the PROFILE.TCPIP data set
includes the keyword NETMAN. Following is an example of such a definition:
<br><br><img src="3376f145.gif"><br><br>
<p>Please refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2 Release 3 for VM: Planning and
Customization</i> and <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 3 Release 1 for MVS: Customization
and Administration Guide</i> for details.
<p>The SNMP starter set from TCP/IP for MVS provides NetView operators with the
tool to manage the TCP/IP network. NetView commands can be entered from the
SNMP main panel and standard PF key definitions used in the other NetView
components are used within SNMP CLISTs.
<p>Full documentation of the starter set is in member SNMPREXX in
<i>tcpip.v3r1.</i>SEZAINST. The full screen panels require NetView Version 1
Release 3 (they are written in REXX).

<p>The remote PING is implemented in TCP/IP for MVS. With this an SNMP monitor
can send a remote PING via an SNMP GET request to the MVS TCP/IP SNMP agent.
When the SNMP agent receives this SNMP GET request, it issues a PING command to
the specified host and returns the round-trip time value as reply to the SNMP
GET request.

<h4><a name="H729">4.14.12.2  AIX/ESA</a>

processes to display/save traps, build SNMP request packets and SNMP get, next
and save commands. For details, please refer to <i>AIX Version 3.2 for RISC
System/6000 General Programming Concepts</i>. snmpd generates four types of
Traps: <i>coldStart</i>, <i>linkUp</i>, <i>linkDown</i> and
<i>authenticationFailure</i>. The <i>gated</i> daemon generates an
<i>egpNeighborLoss</i> TRAP whenever it puts an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)
neighbor into the down state.
<p>The files /etc/mib.defs and /etc/mib_desc store the MIB-II variables used by
various programs. New MIB objects can be added by using the mosy command.

<p>TCP/IP for OS/2 provides both an SNMP client and an SNMP agent.
<p>Its SNMP client (manager) provides the following functions:
<ul>
<li><i>SNMPGRP</i> can retrieve values from the following groups of MIBs:
system, interfaces, address translation, ip, icmp, tcp and udp.
<li><i>SNMP</i> can retrieve values from a single MIB. It does not support the
SetRequest PDU.
<li><i>SNMPTRAP</i> is an OS/2 PM application which receives and displays
unsolicited notification of traps from SNMP agents. If the window is minimized,
the icon shown is black. It turns red when a trap is received.
<li><i>SNMPREQD</i> verifies incoming responses with outstanding requests. It
must be started before any SNMP client commands.
</ul>
<p>Its SNMP agent provides the following functions:
<ul>
<li><i>SNMPD</i> starts the SNMP agent. It supports the following groups of
MIBs: system, interface, address translation, ip, icmp, tcp and udp. It also
supports the SNMP agent DPI, which allows external processes to generate SNMP
Traps. SNMPD generates three types of Traps: <i>coldStart</i>,
<i>authenticationFailure</i> and <i>enterpriseSpecific</i>.
<p>The file <i>MIB2.TBL</i> in your ETC subdirectory stores the MIB-II
variables. It can be customized for your network environment. New MIB objects
can be added as needed. Please refer to <i>IBM TCP/IP Version 2.0 for OS/2:
User's Guide</i> for more details.
