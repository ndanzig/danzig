<h2><a name="dlsw">2.15  Data Link Switching: Switch-to-Switch Protocol</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index1005>Data</a> Link Switching (DLSw) was issued by IBM in March
1993 and is documented in RFC number 1795.  Its state is informational.

<h3><a name="H276">2.15.1  Introduction</a>
</h3>
<p>Data Link Switching is a forwarding mechanism for the IBM SNA and IBM
NetBIOS protocols. It does not provide full routing, but instead provides
switching at the data link layer and encapsulation in TCP/IP for transport over
the Internet. This Switch-to-Switch Protocol (SSP) is used between IBM 6611
Network Processors and/or IBM 2210 Nways Multiprotocol Routers. Routers of
other vendors can participate if they comply to the above RFC or without DLSw
capability as intermediate routers because the DLSw connection exists only
between the two end routers.

<h3><a name="H277">2.15.2  Functional Description</a>
</h3>
<p>DLSw was developed to provide support for SNA and NetBIOS in multiprotocol
routers. Since SNA and NetBIOS are basically connection-oriented protocols, the
data link control procedure that they use on the LAN is IEEE 802.2 Logical Link
Control (LLC) Type 2. DLSw also accommodates SNA protocols over WAN links via
the SDLC protocol.
<p>IEEE 802.2 LLC Type 2 was designed with the assumption that the network
transit delay would be small and predictable (for example a local LAN).
Therefore LLC uses a fixed timer for detecting lost frames. When bridging is
used over wide area lines (especially at lower speeds), the network delay is
larger and can vary greatly based upon congestion. When the delay exceeds the
timeout value LLC attempts to retransmit. If the frame is not actually lost,
only delayed, it is possible for the LLC Type 2 procedures to become confused,
and as a result, the link is eventually taken down.
<p>Given the use of LLC Type 2 services, DLSw addresses the following bridging
problems:
<ul>
<li>DLC timeouts
<li>DLC acknowledgments over the WAN
<li>Flow and congestion control
<li>Broadcast control of search packets
<li>Source-route bridging hop count limits
</ul>
<p>NetBIOS also makes extensive use of datagram services that use LLC Type 1.
In this case, DLSw addresses the last two problems in the above list. The
principal difference between DLSw and bridging is that DLS terminates the data
link control whereas bridging does not.
<a href="3376c215.html#figdls2br">Figure - DLSw Compared to Bridging</a>
illustrates this difference based upon two end systems operating with LLC Type
2 services.

<br><i>Figure: DLSw Compared to Bridging</i><br><br>
<p>In traditional bridging, the data link control is end-to-end. DLSw
terminates the LLC Type 2 connection at the switch. This means that the LLC
Type 2 connections do not cross the wide area network. The DLS multiplexes LLC
connections onto a TCP connection to another DLS. Therefore, the LLC
connections at each end are totally independent of each other. It is the
responsibility of the data link switch to deliver frames that it has received
from an LLC connection to the other end. TCP is used between the data link
switches to guarantee delivery of frames.
<p>As a result of this design, LLC timeouts are limited to the local LAN (for
example they do not traverse the wide area). Also, the LLC Type 2
acknowledgments (RRs) do not traverse the WAN, thereby reducing traffic across
the wide area links. For SDLC links, polling and poll response occurs locally,
not over the WAN. Broadcast of search frames is controlled by the data link
switches once the location of a target system is discovered. Finally, the
switches can now apply back pressure to the end systems to provide flow and
congestion control.
<p>DLSw uses LAN addressing to set up connections between SNA systems. SDLC
attached devices are defined with MAC addresses to enable them to communicate
with LAN-attached devices. For NetBIOS systems, DLSw uses the NetBIOS name to
forward datagrams and to set up connections for NetBIOS sessions. For circuit
establishment, SNA systems send TEST (or in some cases, XID) frames to the null
(x'00') SAP. NetBIOS systems have an address resolution procedure, based upon
the Name Query and Name Recognized frames, that is used to establish an
end-to-end circuit.
<p>Since DLSw may be implemented in multiprotocol routers, there may be
situations where both bridging and switching are enabled. SNA frames can be
identified by their link SAP. Typical SAP values for SNA are x'04', x'08', and
x'0C'. NetBIOS always uses a link SAP value of x'F0'.
