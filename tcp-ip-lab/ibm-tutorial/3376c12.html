TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview
</title>
<body>

<h2><a name="H16">1.2  Internetworks</a>
</h2>
<p><a name=index504>Those</a> original designers, funded by the <i>Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency</i> <a name=index505>(DARPA),</a>
<a name=index508>of</a> the <i>ARPANET protocol suite</i>
<a name=index510>introduced</a> fundamental concepts such as <i>layering</i>
and <i>virtualizing</i> in the world of networking, well before ISO even took
an interest in networking.
<p>The official organism of those researchers was the
<a name=index511>ARPANET</a> Network Working Group, which had its last general
meeting in October 1971. <a name=index512>DARPA</a> has continued its research
for an internetworking protocol suite, from the early <i>NCP (Network Control
Program)</i> host-to-host protocol to the TCP/IP protocol suite, which took its
current form around 1978. At that time, DARPA was well known for its pioneering
of packet-switching over radio networks and satellite channels. The first real
implementations of the <i>Internet</i> <a name=index513>were</a> found around
1980 when DARPA started converting the machines of its research network
(ARPANET) to use the new TCP/IP protocols. In 1983, the transition was
completed and DARPA demanded that <i>all</i> computers willing to connect to
its ARPANET use TCP/IP.
<p>DARPA also contracted Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) to develop an
implementation of the TCP/IP protocols for Berkeley UNIX on the VAX and funded
the University of California at Berkeley to distribute that code free of charge
with their UNIX operating system. The first release of the <i>Berkeley System
Distribution</i> <a name=index514>to</a> include the TCP/IP protocol set was
made available in 1983 (4.2BSD). From that point on, TCP/IP has been rapidly
spreading among universities and research centers and has become the standard
communications subsystem for all UNIX connectivity. The second release (4.3BSD)
was distributed in 1986, with updates in 1988 (4.3BSD Tahoe) and 1990 (4.3BSD
Reno). 4.4BSD was released in 1993. Due to funding constraints, 4.4BSD will be
the last release of the BSD by the Computer Systems Research Group of the
University of California at Berkeley.
<p>As TCP/IP internetworking spread rapidly, new wide area networks were
created in the US and connected to ARPANET. In turn, other networks in the rest
of the world, not necessarily based on the TCP/IP protocols were added to the
set of interconnected networks. The result is what is described as <i>The
Internet</i>. Some examples of the different networks which have played key
roles in this development are described in the next sections.

<h3><a name="H17">1.2.1  The Internet</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index515>What</a> exactly is the Internet?  First, the word
<i>internet</i> (also <i>internetwork</i>) is simply a contraction of the
phrase <i>interconnected network</i>.  However when written with a capital
``I'' the Internet refers to a worldwide set of interconnected networks, so the
Internet is an internet, but the reverse does not follow. The Internet is
sometimes called the <i>connected Internet</i>.
<p>The Internet consists of the following groups of networks (see the following
sections for more information on some of these):
<ul>
<li>Backbones: large networks which exist primarily to interconnect other
networks.  Currently the backbones are NSFNET in the US, EBONE in Europe and
large commercial backbones.
<li>Regional networks connecting, for example, universities and colleges.
<li>Commercial networks providing access to the backbones to subscribers, and
networks owned by commercial organizations for internal use which also have
connections to the Internet.
<li>Local networks, such as campus-wide university networks.
</ul>
<p>In many cases, particularly for commercial, military and government
networks, traffic between these networks and the rest of the Internet is
restricted (see also <a href="3376c63.html#firewal">Firewalls</a>). This leads
to the question: how do I know if I am connected to the Internet? One workable
approach is to ask the question: can I ping the host <i>ds.internic.net</i>?
Ping, described in <a href="3376c25.html#ping">Ping</a>, is a program used for
determining the reachability of hosts on internets, implemented on every TCP/IP
platform. If the answer to this question is ``no'', then you are not connected.
This definition does not necessarily mean that you are completely cut off from
the Internet: many systems which would fail this test have, for example,
electronic mail gateways to the Internet.

<h3><a name="arpanet">1.2.2  ARPANET</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index516>Sometimes</a> referred to as the ``grand-daddy of packet
networks'', the ARPANET was built by DARPA (which was called ARPA at that time)
in the late 60s to accommodate research equipment on packet-switching
technology and to allow resource sharing <a name=index517>for</a> the
Department of Defense's contractors. The network interconnected research
centers, some military bases and government locations. It soon became popular
with researchers for collaboration through electronic mail and other services.
It was developed <a name=index518>into</a> a research utility run by the
Defense Communications Agency (DCA) by the end of 1975 and split in 1983
<a name=index520>into</a> MILNET for interconnection of military sites and
ARPANET for interconnection of research sites. This formed the beginning of the
``<a name=index521>capital</a> I'' Internet.
<p>In 1974, the ARPANET was based on 56 Kbps leased lines which interconnected
<i>packet-switching nodes</i> (PSN) scattered across the continental US and
western Europe. These were minicomputers running a protocol known as
<i>1822</i> (after the number of a report describing it) and dedicated to the
packet-switching task. Each PSN had at least two connections to other PSNs (to
allow alternate routing in case of circuit failure) and up to 22 ports for user
computer (<i>host</i>) connections. These 1822 systems offered reliable,
flow-controlled delivery of a packet to a destination node. This is the reason
why the original <i>NCP</i> protocol was a rather simple protocol. It was
replaced by the TCP/IP protocols, which do not assume reliability of the
underlying network hardware and can be used on other-than-1822 networks. This
1822 protocol did not become an industry standard, so DARPA decided later to
replace the 1822 packet switching technology with the <i>CCITT X.25</i>
standard.
<p>Data traffic rapidly exceeded the capacity of the 56 Kbps lines that made up
the network, which were no longer able to support the necessary throughput.
Today the ARPANET has been replaced by new technologies in its role of backbone
on the research side of the connected Internet (see NSFNET later in this
chapter), whereas MILNET continues to form the backbone of the military side.

<h3><a name="nsfnet">1.2.3  NSFNET</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index522>NSFNET,</a> the National Science Foundation Network, is a
three-level internetwork in the United States consisting of:
<ul>
<li>The <i>backbone</i>: a network that connects separately administered and
operated mid-level networks and NSF-funded supercomputer centers.  The backbone
also has transcontinental links to other networks such as EBONE, the European
IP backbone network.
<li><i>Mid-level networks</i>: of three kinds (regional, discipline-based and
supercomputer consortium networks).
<li><i>Campus networks</i>: whether academic or commercial, connected to the
mid-level networks.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>
First Backbone
<dd>Originally established by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as a
communications network for researchers and scientists to access the NSF
supercomputers, the first NSFNET backbone used six DEC LSI/11 microcomputers as
packet switches, interconnected by 56 Kbps leased lines. A primary
interconnection between the NSFNET backbone and the ARPANET existed at Carnegie
Mellon, which allowed routing of datagrams between users connected to each of
those networks.
<dt>
Second Backbone
<dd>The need for a new backbone appeared in 1987, when the first one became
overloaded within a few months (estimated growth at that time was 100% per
year). The NSF and MERIT, Inc., a computer network consortium of eight
state-supported universities in Michigan, agreed to develop and manage a new,
higher-speed backbone with larger transmission and switching capacities. To
manage it they defined the <i>Information Services</i> (IS) which is comprised
of an Information Center and a Technical Support Group. The Information Center
is responsible for information dissemination, information resource management
and electronic communication. The Technical Support Group provides support
directly to the field. The purpose of this is to provide an integrated
information system with easy-to-use-and-manage interfaces accessible from any
point in the network supported by a full set of training services.
<p>Merit and NSF conducted this project in partnership with IBM and MCI. IBM
provided the software, packet-switching and network-management equipment, while
MCI provided the long-distance transport facilities. Installed in 1988, the new
network initially used 448 Kbps leased circuits to interconnect 13 <i>nodal
switching systems</i> (NSS) supplied by IBM. Each NSS was composed of nine IBM
RT systems (running an IBM version of 4.3BSD UNIX) loosely coupled via two IBM
Token-Ring Networks (for redundancy). One Integrated Digital Network Exchange
(IDNX) supplied by IBM was installed at each of the 13 locations, to provide:
<ul>
<li>Dynamic alternate routing
<li>Dynamic bandwidth allocation
</ul>
<dt>
Third Backbone
<dd>In 1989, the NSFNET backbone circuits topology was reconfigured after
traffic measurements and the speed of the leased lines increased to T1 (1.544
Mbps) using primarily fiber optics.
<p>Due to the constantly increasing need for improved packet switching and
transmission capacities, three NSSs were added to the backbone and the link
speed was upgraded. The migration of the NSFNET backbone from T1 to T3 (45Mbps)
was completed in late 1992. Advanced Network &amp; Services, Inc. (a company
formed by IBM, MCI, and Merit, Inc.) currently provides and manages the NSFNET.
</dl>
<p>The migration to gigabit levels has already started and will continue
through the late 1990s. For an overview, please see
<a href="3376c14.html#future">Future</a>.
<p>In April 1995 the US government intends to remove its funding of NFSNET.
This is in part a reaction to the growing commercial use of NSFNET.  For more
on the commercial use of the Internet plus the US government plans refer to
<a href="3376c12.html#comi">Commercial Use of the Internet</a> and
<a href="3376c12.html#ish">Information Super Highway</a> respectively.

<h3><a name="ebone">1.2.4  EBONE</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index523>EBONE,</a> the Pan-European Multi-Protocol Backbone plays
the same role in Europe for Internet traffic as the NSFNET backbone does in the
United States.  EBONE has kilobit and megabit links between five major centers.

<h3><a name="H21">1.2.5  CREN</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index524>Completed</a> in October 1989, the merger of the two
already well known networks CSNET (the Computer+Science Network) and BITNET
(the <i>Because It's Time</i> Network) formed the Corporation for Research and
Educational Networking. CREN draws on both of its historical CSNET and BITNET
service families to provide a rich variety of network connection options:
<dl>
<dt>
PhoneNet
<dd>Is the original CSNET network service and provides a store-and-forward
electronic mail service using dial-up telephone lines (1200/2400 bps). It
allows CSNET service members to exchange messages with other CREN members and
with other major mail networks, including NSFNET, MILNET, etc.
<dt>
X.25Net
<dd>Is a CSNET full-service Internet-connected network that uses TCP/IP
protocols on top of X.25. It is the common method for international members to
connect to CSNET, since they can use their local X.25 Public Data Network to
reach Telenet in the US. It provides file transfer, remote login, and immediate
electronic mail service between X.25Net hosts.
<dt>
Dial-up IP
<dd>Is an implementation of SLIP (Serial Line IP) that allows sites using the
switched telephone network (9600 bps) to send IP packets, by means of a central
server, to the Internet. Users of this method thus have the same services as
X.25Net sites.
<dt>
Leased Line IP
<dd>Used by many CREN members to connect to CREN. A variety of link speeds are
supported up to T1 rates.
<dt>
RSCS/NJE over BISYNC
<dd>Traditionally runs over leased lines at 9600 bps and provides interactive
messages, unsolicited file transfer and electronic mail.
<dt>
RSCS over IP
<dd>Allows BITNET service hubs to relax the dedicated RSCS bisync line in
preference to an Internet IP route, if one exists.
</dl>

<h3><a name="H22">1.2.6  Cypress</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index525>Cypress</a> is a leased-line network that provides a
low-cost, protocol-independent, packet switching system used primarily for
interconnecting small sites to the TCP/IP Internet. Originally established as
part of a joint research project with CSNET, it is now independent of CSNET.
<p>There are no restrictions on its use, outside those imposed by other
networks. Thus commercial traffic can pass between two industrial sites across
Cypress. Industrial sites cannot pass commercial traffic onto the Internet due
to restrictions imposed by government agencies that control the backbone
networks (for example NSFNET).

<h3><a name="H23">1.2.7  DRI</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index526>The</a> Terrestrial Wideband Network is a wide area network
whose purpose is to provide a platform for research on high-speed networking
protocols and applications (this role was formerly played by the ARPANET). This
system includes both connection-oriented as well as connectionless service,
broadcast and multicast service and real-time conferencing.
<p>The Terrestrial Wideband Network was built and deployed by BBN Systems and
Technologies Corporation during the first half of 1989 as part of the initial
phase of the Defense Research Internet (DRI). Its main purpose was to carry
cross-country Internet datagram traffic associated with DARPA-funded projects.
It was composed of Internet gateways and Terrestrial Wideband Network packet
switches (WPS) which communicated with each other using the Host Access
Protocol (HAP) specified in RFC 1221. Wideband Monitoring Protocol (WB-MON) was
used between the WPSs and the monitoring center. The backbone also supported a
research environment for multimedia conferencing and voice/video conferencing
using gateways that used a real-time connection-oriented protocol (ST-II -
Stream Protocol - RFC 1190) over a connectionless network.

<h3><a name="H24">1.2.8  European Academic Research Network (EARN)</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index528>EARN,</a> started in 1983, was the first and largest
network serving academic and research institutions in Europe, the Middle East
and Africa. EARN was initially started with help from IBM. It evolved to become
a non-profit non-commercial traffic-based network serving academic and research
institutions.

<h3><a name="H25">1.2.9  R&eacute;seaux Associ&eacute;s pour la Recherche
Europ&eacute;enne (RARE)</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index530>RARE,</a> founded in 1986, is the association of European
networking organizations and their users. The association has 20 voting <i>Full
National Members</i> (all of which are European countries), several
<i>Associate National Members</i> (some European and Asian countries),
<i>International Members</i> (for example EARN) and <i>Liason Members</i> (for
example CREN).
<p>It supports the principles of open systems as defined by the ISO as well as
a number of mainly European groups, such as the <i>European Workshop for Open
Systems</i> <a name=index532>(EWOS)</a> and the <i>European Telecommunications
Standards Institute</i> <a name=index534>(ETSI).</a>

Recherche Europ&eacute;enne (RARE)</i>.

<h3><a name="H26">1.2.10  R&eacute;seaux IP Europ&eacute;ens (RIPE)</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index536>R</a>&eacute;seaux IP Europ&eacute;ens (RIPE) coordinates
TCP/IP networking for the research community in Europe. It operates under the
auspices of RARE. RIPE has been functioning since 1989. By the early 1990s more
than 60 organizations were participating in the work. The objective of RIPE is
to ensure the necessary administrative and technical coordination to allow the
operation of a pan-European <i>IP</i> network. Note that RIPE does <i>not</i>
operate a network of its own. RIPE is the <i>IP</i> activity of RARE.
<p>One of the activities of RIPE is to maintain a database of European IP
networks, DNS domains and their contact persons.  The content of this database
is considered to be public information. The database can be accessed either via
a <i>WHOIS</i> server on host <i>whois.ripe.net</i> (TCP port 43) or via
anonymous FTP to <i>ftp.ripe.net</i>.

<h3><a name="H27">1.2.11  Japanese Internet</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index539>Japan</a> has many different networks. The following are
some major ones.
<ul>
<li>The Japanese BITNET was started in 1985. It is funded by members and the
Science University of Tokyo. This network connects to CUNY (City University of
New York) via a 56 Kbps link.
<li><a name=index540>N-1net</a> is managed by the <i>National Center for
Science and Information Systems</i> <a name=index541>(NACSIS),</a> a research
institute funded by the Ministry of Education in Japan. It started operation in
1980 using an X.25 packet-switching network. N-1net has a 50 Kbps link to the
NSF in Washington.
<li><a name=index543>Todai</a> International Science Network (TISN) is used by
physicists and chemists. TISN has a 128 Kbps link between Todai and Hawaii.
<li><i>Widely Integrated Distributed Environment</i>
<a name=index544>(WIDE)</a> is the Japanese Internet. It started as a research
project in 1986. There are two links between WIDE and the rest of the Internet.
One 192 Kbps link is from Keio University in Fujisawa to the University of
Hawaii. A secondary 128 Kbps link from Todai to Hawaii serves as a backup.

<h3><a name="comi">1.2.12  Commercial Use of the Internet</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index550>In</a> recent years the Internet has grown in size and
range at a greater rate than anyone could have predicted.  In particular, more
than half of the hosts now connected to the Internet are of a commercial
nature. This is an area of potential and actual conflict with the initial aims
of the Internet, which were to foster open communications between academic and
research institutions.  However, the continued growth in commercial use of the
Internet is inevitable so it will be helpful to explain how this evolution is
taking place.
<p>One important initiative to consider is that of the <i>Acceptable Use Policy
(AUP)</i>.  The first of these policies was introduced in 1992 and applies to
the use of NSFNET.  A copy of this can be obtained at
<i>nic.merit.edu/nsfnet/acceptable.use.policies</i>. At the heart of this AUP
is a commitment "to support open research and education".  Under "Unacceptable
Uses" is a prohibition of "use for for-profit activities", unless covered by
the General Principle or as a specifically acceptable use.  However, in spite
of this apparently restrictive stance the NSFNET has increasingly been used for
a broad range of activities, including many of a commercial nature.
<p>Apart from the NSFNET AUP, many of the internets that connect to NSFNET
maintain their own AUPs.  Some of these are relatively restrictive in their
treatment of commercial activities while others are relatively liberal.  The
main thing to say is that AUPs will need to evolve as the inevitable growth in
commercial use continues.
<p>Let us now focus on the Internet service providers who have been most active
in introducing commercial uses to the Internet.  Two worth mentioning are
PSINet and UUNET, which began in the late 80s to offer Internet access to both
businesses and individuals.  The California-based CERFnet provides services
that are free of any AUP. An organization to interconnect PSINet, UUNET and
CERFnet was formed soon after, called the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX).
To date CIX has more than 20 members connecting member internets in an AUP-free
environment.  At about the same time that CIX was conceived, a non-profit
company, Advance Network and Services (ANS), was formed by IBM, MCI and Merit,
Inc. to operate T1 backbone connections for NSFNET. This group has been active
in increasing the commercial presence on the Internet.
<p>ANS also formed a commercially oriented subsidiary called ANS CO+RE to
provide linkage between commercial customers and the research and education
domains.  ANS CO+RE provides AUP-free access to NSFNET as well as being linked
to CIX.

<h3><a name="ish">1.2.13  Information Super Highway</a>
</h3>
<p><a name=index551>One</a> recent and important initiative has been the
creation of the US Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure
headed by Al Gore.  In essence, this initiative makes the creation of a
"network of networks" a national priority.  This network would be similar to
the existing Internet in some respects but with government and industry
contributing those elements which it is best able to provide.
<p>From a more international perspective The Group of Seven (G7) ministers met
in Brussels in February 1995 to discuss the emerging Global Information
Infrastructure (GII). The conference was attended by science, technology and
economic ministers of Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Germany, Italy
and the United States, and focused on technological, cultural and economic
issues regarding the development of an international infrastructure.
<p>A free electronic magazine called G7 Live was used to deliver daily
wrap-ups, commentary and news about the conference to Internet users worldwide.
Specific issues covered by G7 Live include intellectual property rights,
infrastructure building, cultural and regulatory considerations and
descriptions of the more than 100 technology exhibits that were present at the
conference.
<p>Both the NII and the GII described above are important initiatives which
should ultimately lead to the "Information Super Highway" that is presently the
subject of so much discussion in the media.
