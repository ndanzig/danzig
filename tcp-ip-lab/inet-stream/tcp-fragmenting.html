<p>
As mentioned in the function summary (in pseudo-code), in the 
<a href = "../func-summary.html#recv">section on reading and receiving</a>,
when reading or receiving a stream in a TCP application, you cannot
know in advance how TCP will fragment the stream of data.
Thus, what is sent in one write/send call, might need several
read/recv calls.  See 
<a href = "../func-summary.html#recv">there</a>.

<p>
The code here shows an example.  Here are the files:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="large-stream-cli.c">client</a>, or sender.
<li>The <a href="large-stream-serv.c">server</a>, or receiver.
<li>The <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>, to show you how to compile
    them.  If you are not familiar with the 'make' command, you can type 'man
    make', or, better, read about 'make' via emacs' info mode.
<li>Here are other files that are needed to build these programs:
    <ul>
    <li>Code to convert <a href="../common-code/socket_address.c">strings
        to socket addresses</a>, and vice-versa.
    <il>Code to check for <a href="../common-code/null_str.c">null
        strings and pointers</a>.
    </ul>
</ul>
