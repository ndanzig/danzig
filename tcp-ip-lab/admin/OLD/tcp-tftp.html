<ol type="I">
<p><li><b>INTRODUCTION</b> --
    This project is to write a TFTP-like server that is based on TCP
    instead of UDP.  Other differences between this server and the UDP
    one are as follows:

    <ol type="A">
    <p><li>We let TCP worry about reliability, so this protocol does not
        have to.

    <p><li>We'll use the telnet client as the client for this server.
        For this reason, this protocol will use text commands, and
        we'll assume that all the files we transfer will be text.

    <p><li>Your server must be able to handle more than one client at a time.
    </ol>

<p><li><b>PROTOCOL</b>
    After starting the server, telnet to the server's host and port.
    This starts the connection.  At this point, the user types one of
    the following commands at the telnet client:

    <ol type="A">
    <p><li><tt>get</tt> <i>filename</i> -- the server will then transfer
        the specified file to the client.  The telnet client will
        simply display this on the screen (this is one reason we will
        deal only with text files).  After transferring the file, the
        server will write one additional line containing only the word
        'eof' (end of file) to the client.  Note that this last line
        cannot have any spaces before the 'eof'.

    <p><li><tt>put</tt> <i>filename</i> -- the client intends to send a
        file to the server.  The telnet client will not actually read
        a file; instead the user types in a message at the screen of
        the telnet client (this is another reason we will deal only
        with text files).  This message can be more than one line.
	The client signals that he is done by
        typing a line containing only the word 'eof'.

    <p><li><tt>bye</tt> -- this ends the connection.  Note that the
        server does <em>not</em> exit.  Rather, he just ends the
        connection with this client.
    </ol>

    <p>
    When appropriate, the server can send an error message to the
    client.  Each line of the error message should start with
    <tt>ERR:</tt>.

<p><li><b>OTHER REQUIREMENTS</b>

    <ol type="A">
    <p><li>The server must log the following:
        <ol type="1">
	<li>the port it is listening on

	<li>beginning of each connection, and the IP number and port
	    of the client.

	<li>end of each session.

	<li>each file transfer, including the name of the file.

	</ol>

    <p><li>Prevent buffer overflows.  For example, use
        <tt>str</tt><b>n</b><tt>cpy()</tt> instead of <tt>strcpy()</tt>.

    <p><li>If you use <tt>fork()</tt> to handle more than one client
       at a time, output from different child processes might get
       mixed up in the output.  Don't worry about that.

    <p><li>The server must respond appropriately to invalid requests.

    </ol>

<p><li><b>SUGGESTIONS</b>
    <ol type="A">
    <p><li>I suggest using <tt>fork()</tt> instead of
       <tt>select()</tt> to handle more than one client at a time.

    <p><li>The telnet client appends carriage return and linefeed
        characters at the end of each line it sends.  Be aware of this
        when you extract the file name from the requests.  I hope to
        post a function that will help in this.

    </ol>

</ol>

<p>
Good luck.
