<!------------------------------------------------------>
<H2><a name="edit">EDIT HISTORY:</a></H2>
<dl>
<dt>04 Shvat 5760 (11/01/2000)
<dd>Added link to project and test results.

<dt>05 Tevet 5760 (14/12/1999)
<dd><ol>
    <li>Eliminated the fourth project and all the tests (except for the
        one accompanying the first project).  In addition, pushed back the
        deadlines for projects 2 and 3 back one week.
    <li>Added table of contents.
    </ol>

<dt>13 Kislev 5760 (22/11/1999)
<dd>We changed the testing so that it happens during the lab
    sessions.  Thus, I changed the schedule to better explain when
    each test was.

<dt>29 Cheshvan 5760 (08/11/1999)
<dd><ol>
    <li>Added information on the <a href="#deadlines">deadlines</a>.
    <li>Changed the schedule of topics covered in the next few weeks.
        We'll cover timeouts and basic TCP clients, then handling more
	than one client at a time.
    </ol>

<dt>28 Cheshvan 5760 (07/11/1999)
<dd><ol>
    <li>Corrected what we convered 25 Cheshvan (04/11/1999).  
    <li>Added 'no time-out' to description of first project, which is
        due 09 Kislev (18/11/1999).
    </ol>

    <li><a href="grading.html">Project requirements and grading procedures</a>
    <li><a href="results.html">Project and test results</a>
    </ul>

<li>that this schedule might change during the course of the
    semester, though I hope not to.

<li>Because students are required to come to only about 1/2 of the
    sessions, in many cases I'll repeat a subject 2 weeks in a row.

<li><b><a name="deadlines">Deadlines:</a></b>
    <ul>
    <li>The projects must be submitted by the day indicated
        <em>before</em> the lab session for that day.  See the
	<a href="grading.html">grading and project instructions</a>
        for how to submit them.
    <li>You will be orally tested on the project you turn in (to make
        sure you really understand it), during one of the following
        lab sessions:

	<ol type="A">
	<li>the session on the day that the project is due, <em>or</em>
	<li>the following session.
	</ol>

	<p>
	This is slightly different for the first and last projects.
	See the schedule below for details.

	<p>
	We spread the testing over 2 sessions, because students are
	required to come to only half the sessions.

	<p>
	You might have noticed that Dr. Teichtel has circulated
	among the students during the lab session, while I talked.
	He'll be testing you this time.

	<p>
	A few students have received exemptions from coming to lab
	sessions.  These students should schedule a time for me to
	test them, within a week after the project is due.

    <li>See the
	<a href="grading.html#early-late">grading and project instructions</a>
	for how being late or early will affect your grade.

    <li>Besides being tested on your understanding of your projects,
        you will also be tested on other subjects.  These tests are short.
    </ul>
