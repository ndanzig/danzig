<h2>1. The 2 Techniques</h2>

<p>
Some protocols have sessions.  That is, the interaction between them
consist of several transactions.  Most such
protocols are TCP (e.g., telnet and FTP), but some are UDP (e.g., 
<a href="http:../tftp/index.html">TFTP</a>).

<blockquote>
Some protocols are very simple and short, e.g., the time and daytime
protocols which simply return the current time in response to a
request.  Other protocols might involve many transactions between the
client and server, but the protocol does not group these transactions
together into a single protocol.  One example of this is NFS, the
Network File Service, which allows host A to mount filesystems that
reside on host B's disks.
</blockquote>

<p>
To handle sessions, it is common for the server to 
<b>create a new socket</b>
to run the session on.  The client can find out the address of the new
socket by receiving the reply via the 
<a href="http:../func-summary.html#recvfrom">recvfrom</a> or
<a href="http:../func-summary.html#recvmsg">recvmsg</a> functions.

<p>
A related technique is to <b>fork a child process</b> for the session.  This
simplifies code because it makes it easier to separate the code that
gets the initial request from the code that handles the session.
It also means that the session handling code needs to worry about one
session; each session is handled by a different process.

<h2>2. The Word Guess Game</b>

<h3>2.1. General Description</h3>

<p>
To demonstrate these techniques for the UDP protocol, we'll program a
game called 'word guess'.  In this game, the client tries to guess a 7
letter word.  He guesses one letter at a time.  He loses if he gets 4
wrong guesses; he wins if he guesses all the letters in the word
with less than 4 wrong guesses.  The server keeps track of the
client's guesses, tells the client whether or not his last guess was
correct, and determines whether the client has won or lost.

<p>
The client requests a game by sending a single letter to the server at
its 'well known port'.  The server creates a new socket which is bound
to a new port to handle the rest of the game.  

<p>
After each guess by the client, the server sends back a message saying
whether it was wrong or right.  In addition, it also shows the words
with the correctly guessed letters filled in.  And it also shows the
incorrect guesses.  And, finally it checks each time whether or not
the game is over.

<h3>2.2. Formats of the Packets</h3>

<p>
The packet sent by the client always consist of one character, which
is a letter a-z.

<p>
The packet sent by the server has the following fields:
<ol>
<li>Status code (1 byte of text).  This can have one of the following
    values:
    <dl>
    <dt>'y'
    <dd>(yes) The last guess was right, but the game is not yet over.

    <dt>'n'
    <dd>(no) The last guess was wrong, but the game is not yet over.

    <dt>'w'
    <dd>(won) The client won.

    <dt>'l'
    <dd>(lost) The client lost.
    </dl>

<li>A text message, terminated by 0.  This will be no more than 80
    characters.
</ol>
