<H2>The server:</H2>

<pre>
	sd = socket ( PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, def_proto )

	sname = ( INADDR_ANY, let_system_choose_port )

	bind ( sd, sname, sname_len )

	getsockname (sd, &sname, &sname_len)

	print the port (taken from sname) that we are listening on

	loop forever:

	        /* other_sname & other_sname_len will be set to the */
		/* name of the socket that sent to us. */

		recvfrom ( sd, &buf, buflen, flags,   
		           &other_sname,  &other_sname_len )

		reply_msg = current system time

		sendto ( sd,  reply_msg, reply_msg_len,
			 other_sname, other_sname_len )
</pre>

<H2>The client:</H2>

<pre>
	sd = socket ( PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, def_proto )

	request_message  = "t"  /* doesn't matter what it is */

	other_sname = ( IP_of_server, port_of_server )

	sendto ( sd, request_message, request_message_len,
		 other_sname, other_sname_len )

	bytes_read = read ( sd, &time_buf, max_bytes)
</pre>

<H2>Further Notes:</H2>

<p>
There are in fact offical TCP/IP protocols for a time service.  They are:

<dl>
<dt>daytime
<dd>the server sends back the current date and time as a text string.
    This service is available in both TCP (streams) & UDP (datagrams)
    on port 13.

    <p>
    To get the time, the client simply connects (TCP) or sends a
    request (UDP) to port 13 on the host providing the service.  It
    does not need to send any data.  When the server gets a
    connection/request, it ignores whatever data is sent.  Instead, it
    simply finds out who initiated the request & sends the current
    time back to him. 

<dt>time
<dd>Same as daytime, except:
    <ul>
    <li> sends the current time as the number of seconds since
         01.01.1900 00:00. 
    <li>uses port 37.
    </ul>
</dl>
