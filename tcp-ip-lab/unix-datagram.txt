FILE: unix-datagram

Here is an example in pseudo-code of 2 processes communicating via
UNIX datagram

The receiver:

	sd = socket ( AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM, def_proto )

	/* The sender & receiver have to agree on the name of the */
	/* socket.  One of them must bind to that name.  In this case, */
	/* we have the receiver bind to it. */

	bind ( sd, "/tmp/our_socket", sname_len )

	read ( sd, &buf, buflen )

	close ( sd )

	/* Because the receiver bound to the name, we have to delete */
	/* the file that was created. */

	unlink ( "/tmp/our_socket" )

The sender:
	
	sd = socket ( AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM, def_proto )

	/* Because the receiver bound its socket to the agreed upon */
	/* name, we don't have to specify a name. */

	sendto ( sd, "Hello my friend", msg_len, "/tmp/our_socket", sname_len )

	close ( sd )
