<!---------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
You are probably familiar with FTP, the File Transfer Protocol.  TFTP
is a much simpler protocol for transferring files between machines.
One use of TFTP is when a machine boots up and needs to get a file
from another machine (e.g., the Axil stations in the JCT UNIX lab).

<p>
This page contains links to information about TFTP, since you will be
required to write a TFTP server.

<h2><a name="rfc">RFCs</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="rfc1350.txt">RFC 1350</a> is the document describing the
protocol.  'RFC' stands for 'Request For Comments'; most/all of the
standard TCP/IP protocols are described in an RFC.

<p>
In addition, we have the other RFCs related to TFTP.  You will
probably <em>not</em> need them for this lab, but I am including them
in case you are interested:

<dl>

<dt><a href="rfc906.txt">RFC 906</a>
<dd>Bootstrap loading using TFTP.

<dt><a href="rfc1785.txt">RFC 1785</a>
<dd>TFTP Option Negotiation Analysis.

<dt><a href="rfc2090.txt">RFC 2090</a>
<dd>TFTP Multicast Option.

<dt><a href="rfc2347.txt">RFC 2347</a>
<dd>TFTP Option Extension.

<dt><a href="rfc2348.txt">RFC 2348</a>
<dd>TFTP Blocksize Option.

<h2>TFTP Clients</h2>

<p>
There are TFTP clients that you can use to test the server you write.
There is one called <tt>atftp</tt> (or just <tt>tftp</tt>) on the UNIX
lab workstations.  The 'a' stands for advanced; it supports various
extensions to TFTP (see the <a href="#rfc">RFCs</a> above).

<p>
The client in interactive.  Inside the command, you'll probably want
to run the following commands:

<ul>
<li>mode &nbsp;&nbsp; octet
<li>trace
<li>verbose
<li>connect &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>host</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>port</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp;
(can also specify this on the command line)
<li>get &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>file_on_server</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>file_on_client</i>
<li>put &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>file_on_server</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>file_on_client</i>
</ul>


<p>
There is also a client on host beitza.  This is a different version of
the client, but the user interface is almost the same.  The advantage
of the beitza client is that you can type abbreviations of the above
commands. 

<p>
If you want to get a feel for using TFTP, there is a TFTP server
running on host p-roman.  You can read the file r-00, r-01, and r-02.
You can write to the files w-00, w-01, ..., w-19.  You can also read
these files, so you can check the write was done correctly.
