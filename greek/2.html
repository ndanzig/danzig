"what are you talking about? Would you have us enjoy one another here on the top 
of Mount Ida, where everything can be seen? What if one of the ever-living gods 
should see us sleeping together, and tell the others? It would be such a scandal

wife in his embrace; whereon the earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, 
with dew-bespangled lotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it 
raised them well above the ground. Here they laid themselves down and overhead
