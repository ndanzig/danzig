hurried off to bring the lyre from the king's house, and the nine men who had 
been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was their business to manage 
everything connected with the sports, so they made the ground smooth and marked 
a wide space for the dancers [<E><FOREIGN 
lang=xgreek><B>khoros</B></FOREIGN></E>]. Presently the servant came back with 
Demodokos’ lyre, and he took his place in the midst of them, whereon the best 
young dancers [<E><FOREIGN lang=xgreek><B>khoros</B></FOREIGN></E>] in the town 
began to foot and trip it so nimbly that <A

was very angry when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy 
brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to forge some 
chains which none could either unloose or break, so that they might stay there 
in that place. When he had finished his snare he went into his bedroom and 
festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs; he also let many hang 
down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even a god could see them, so fine 
and subtle were they. As soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he 
made as though he were setting out for the fair state of <A
