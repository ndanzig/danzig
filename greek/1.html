the place where his arms were lying, while Alexander, husband of lovely <A

put on his goodly armor. </DIV>
<P><PP N="121322"></PP><E>[330]</E>&nbsp;First he greaved his legs with greaves 
of good make and fitted with ankle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the 
cuirass of his brother <A

and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about 
his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, 
well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he 
grasped a redoubtable spear that suited his hands. In like fashion <A

also put on his armor. </P>

were struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on the 
measured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against the other. 
Alexander aimed first, and struck the round shield of the son of <A

next took aim, praying to Father <A

as he did so. "King <A

he said, "grant me revenge on Alexander who has wronged me; subdue him under my 
hand that in ages yet to come a man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house 
of his host." </P>
<P><PP N="122633"></PP><E>[355]</E>&nbsp;He poised his spear as he spoke, and 
hurled it at the shield of Alexander. Through shield and cuirass it went, and 
tore the shirt by his flank, but Alexander swerved aside, and thus saved his 
life. Then the son of <A 
href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?type=phrase&amp;alts=0&amp;group=typecat&amp;lookup=Atreus&amp;collection=Perseus:collection:Greco-Roman">Atreus</A> 
drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part of his helmet, but the sword 
fell shivered in three or four pieces from his hand, and he cried, looking 
towards Heaven, "Father <A

of all gods you are the most spiteful; I made sure of my revenge, but the sword 
has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I have not killed 
him." </P>

him by the horsehair plume of his helmet, and began dragging him towards the <A

The strap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and <A

been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that the empty helmet 
came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades among the <A

snatched him up in a moment (as a god can do), hid him under a cloud of 
darkness, and conveyed him to his own bedchamber. </P>

and of whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed robe 
and said, "Come hither; Alexander says you are to go to the house; he is on his 
bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed in gorgeous apparel. No one 
would think he had just come from fighting, but rather that he was going to a 
dance [<E><FOREIGN lang=xgreek><B>khoros</B></FOREIGN></E>], or had done dancing
