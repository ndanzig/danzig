<p>
There are many nitty gritty details in life: buying car insurance, 
paying parking tickets, traffic tickets, phone bills, the rent - 
even obligations like visiting the doctor, the dentist, the supermarket.
More than just all the things we need to do, it is the very thought of them, 
the planning, the worries about them that 
truly bog us down.  These thoughts and worries fill our heads and  cloud our 
minds and deny us inner freedom, freedom of thought. And all these ties bind 
us into our lives without us ever 
really deciding we want to be there. We are not free. We have obligations to
our cars, to the electric company, and to our dental hygienist. It makes a 
person want to throw it all away and be free. 
To take out $500 from his bank and leave his life behind. He will never look back. 
Is his life meaningful in any way really ?  Why stick around.  Untie yourself 
from this trivia of life. Free your mind of thinking of all these details
which are really irrelevant anyway. Don't we just need to get away?

<p> In a formal relationship we follow rules, manners. We are polite.  We 
don't bring up our personal worries, our dreads about life, or problems.  
We discuss polite topics: was this or that movie all that great; is our neighbourhood getting worse; is the mayor an idiotic.  But we don't tell our friends
 about our inner angsts. At least not our regular friends.  
If we do, we are really a bit crazy.  That is not what friends are for.
They can't be dragged down by our stupid tedious troubles.  They are there for
 us to socialize with.  And in this socializing a normal person does not need 
to suppress any desire to discuss these topics.  
It would never occur to him to talk of this inner doubt and frustration with
 life.  Though these thoughts may fill his
every waking moment when friends are not around.  But when they are around, he
 immediately falls into the role of socialite.  He is an actor, and in this 
new world, there are no worries.  The argument he plans to have with his
 insurance company tomorrow does not exist any more.
All he is concerned with is having a good time with his friends.  He is a 
normal social being.  The very rules of polite contact force him to avoid all 
these troubles.  But far from feeling this oppressive, he embraces this 
freedom from his own life.  He is, if but for a short while, free.  And thus 
the salvation of polite society.

<p>This same escape exists for the infamous one-night-stand of recent, though
not really that recent anymore, popularity.  Going to a disco to dance and 
forget ones 
life provides the same relief from thinking of all that one still must do
 tomorrow.  It provides  freedom.  And inviting that young dance partner home
 gives one a relationship where there is no personal life. 
They are two strangers living out a fantasy.  If one  would actually  stop 
everything and start to discuss 
his feelings of frustration with life, with directionlessness, all his worries
and  troubles with this complete stranger, not only would he be breaking the 
rules of the one-night-stand etiquette but he would be destroying the very 
pleasure he was seeking, the pleasure of having no constraints and no worries and no obligation to his life, the pleasure of complete freedom.  He would bring
this person into his life and in so doing bring himself back to reality.
He would rightly be considered a bit 
crazy.  Crazy is the failure to accept the norms of societal role playing. 
Or rather, failure to see those norms at all.  To play Monopoly with out 
understanding what property  ownership means.
The very purpose of this relationship is to have a kind of intimacy where 
there is no deep revealing of ones inner world.
The problem with many relationships is when  one needs to share that inner 
world of angst; then one loses the fantasy that the relationship had provided.
If this other person knows my troubles, then
being with him far from providing me an escape from my life, only serves to 
remind me of my troubles.  He is like a mirror of
everything I have shared with him.  Perhaps it is better to have a relationship
of complete lack of knowledge like Humphrey Bogart in <i>Casablanca</i>.
Neither he nor Ingrid Bergman ever "ask any questions" and their time together in
 Paris is bliss.
They are free from the ties that bind them to their own  mundane lives. 
And both characters do really have worries in their respective lives.
 Sharing only succeeds in destroying any relief the relationship could have
 provided.

<p>
But there is a basic human need to share ones troubles. How can that be 
achieved?  Or is it unhealthy? Or perhaps humour is the only healthy way to 
relieve inner angst.  By seeing others with our own problems, only even more 
extreme, and being able to laugh at them, perhaps that provides us all the 
relief we really need.  Or perhaps meditation, or prayer give us a way to over
 come ourselves, our fears, our troubles.  But maybe a relationship is not a 
good address for this need to reveal.

<p>
In the early part of the 20th century, psychotherapy got to be in vogue.  And
 now in urban circles, it seems a universal need to discuss ones troubles with
 a therapist.  This awakens our troubles.  And if this causes us to constantly
 think of our troubles, it forces us to seek escapes.  Is it a coincidence 
that the sexual revolution coincides roughly with the rise of therapy?  
Perhaps in our unleashing 
our private worlds and polluting our social world, we have sought to
fill that need for escape with the  one-night-stand.
If social life has  become one giant 
psychotherapy session, we will need greater and great escapes to get a little
relief.
We will need relationships of no questions asked.
Or perhaps we need a return to polite society and its truly balanced approach.
Its creation of role playing provides us with a much needed escape from 
ourselves.  And there needs to be a real return to socializing on 
a grand scale.  The increasingly isolated lives of young singles does not provide them with 
sufficient healthy avenues to get away from the mundane constraints of life.
Or should I just take the $500 and run off, never looking back at this crazy world of obligations?
