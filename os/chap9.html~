<h2>Operating Systems Course Outline</h2>


program views all its memory as contiguous but in reality its memory is spread out 
in the computer memory, hence we have problem of external fragmentation


logical addresses are translated int physical ones. OS does the mapping

user cannot access memoryu it does not own, this is desireable


os keeps a frame tabel to know what frames are free and which used, and iff alocated, to which process

os keeps a page table for each process.
