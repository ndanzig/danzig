One could also use<big> M-f</big> and<big> M-b</big> to move one word at
a time  instead  of one character at a time. <br>
<br>
M is short for the Meta key, on your keyboard it will probably  be Alt. 
<br>
<br>
page up is <big>M-v</big>,  page down is <big>C-v</big>.   <br>
<br>
end of line <big>C-e</big>, beginning of line <big>C-a</big>.  <br>
<br>
so much for moving around.  <br>
<br>
The most common method of copy&amp;paste  is by  cutting out using <big>C-k</big>
. <br>
<big>C-k</big> cuts until the end of line, typing C-k many times will cut
many lines. <br>
If you cut a few lines than move around and cut more lines<br>
the first lines would be lost (not including possible undo).  <br>
<br>
In order to paste we will yank the text out of the buffer using <big>C-y</big>
 <br>
you can yank(paste) out however many times you want wherever you want.  <br>
<br>
You can also select text with the mouse, <big>drag to select.</big> <br>
Paste a copy of the text by pressing middle mouse button(or both right and left
<br>if no middle button exists).
Cutting selected text is done by <big>C-w</big>.<br>
