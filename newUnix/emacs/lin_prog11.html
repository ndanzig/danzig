<h2>5) DDD data display debugger  </h2>
This is a powerful tool which is a graphical  interface for an inferior debugger
(usually gdb)  <br>
DDD can do everything your  favorite debugger does and much more, <br>
you can watch the code and execute it line by line, and examine data.  <br>
The speciality of DDD as name might suggest  is its ability to display your
programs data graphically <br>
in a very comfortable manner.<br>
<br>
It will allow you to display structures and dereference   pointers to create
 a visualization of a linked-<br>list or a tree. DDD can also create graphs out
 of arrays.  <br>
<br>
DDD has a gdb command line, so any one who can use gdb can use  DDD and gradually
learn its special features.<br>
<br>

<br>
DDD has excellent support for tracking threads, <br>
and for monitoring and sending signals. See Status menu.<br>
When debugging complex data structures, use <big> Alt-A</big> to <br>
toggle aliases detection.(reoccurring pointers in DB). <br>
