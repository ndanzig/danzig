<h2>4) the gdb debugger </h2>
 <br>
 This is the basic debugger, many linux debuggers are based on it. <br>
 Even though it does not have a fancy GUI, it does do the trick.  <br>
 <br>
 <b>In order to use gdb one must use the -g flag when compiling!<br>
 &nbsp;</b><br>
 Executing gdb is simple:&nbsp; <big>gdb program_name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;</big> (it can be run differently but for that RTFM)  <br>
 <br>
 gdb has an excellent built in help, you can type help from the gdb command 
line<br>
 and get a list of stuff to get help on, or type "help &lt;something&gt;",
and get specific help <br>
on something - either a command or a topic name.<br>
Another good source for help on gdb is the info pages. Type: <big>pinfo gdb</big><br> or <big>info gdb</big> if pinfo is not available.
