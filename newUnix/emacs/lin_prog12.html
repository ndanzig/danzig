<h2>&nbsp;6) valgrind, a good tool  to detect memory management problems:
 </h2>
valgrind can detect problems such as:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Use of uninitialized memory </li>
  <li>Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd</li>
  <li>Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks </li>
  <li>Reading/writing  inappropriate areas on the stack </li>
  <li>Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd  blocks are lost forever
  </li>
  <li>Passing of uninitialized and/or unaddressable  memory to system calls
  </li>
  <li>Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] Vs free/delete/delete  [] </li>
  <li>Some abuses of the POSIX pthread API  </li>
</ul>
valgrind is very easy to use. it has many optional flags you can learn
about from the documentation, valgrind -h<br>
<br>
A useful flag is --num-callers=XXX which sets how far back  to  print the
function call sequence when an error is<br>
detected, (Sometimes  the error actually occurs in a function you didn't
write called by another   function you<br>
didn't...) by default is num-callers=4.<br>
